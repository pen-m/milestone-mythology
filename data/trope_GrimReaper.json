  "description": "\n\n\"My name is Death and the end is here...\"noteImage source from Wikipedia◊\n\n\"When the first living thing existed, I was there, waiting. When the last living thing dies, my job will be finished. I'll put the chairs on tables, turn out the lights, and lock the universe behind me when I leave.\"—Death,The Sandman (1989)\n\nThe mascot of death. The nature and purpose of the Grim Reaper (also simply known as \"Death\") varies between two different versions: one version describes him as a simple guide — the supernatural being who takes people to the afterlife when they die (the fancy word for this is \"Psychopomp\"); another version sees him as the entity of death —he makes people die by touching them or by means of supernatural powers.\n\nEither way, he is generally seen as a tall,often skeletal, specter in a blackhoodedrobewielding aSinister Scythewhen he visits commoners and a sword when he visits royalty, although the scythe is the most popular of his symbols. He is also often shown with anhourglassas a symbol of elapsing life. These dual accouterments areOlder Than Steam, but both were drawn from the ancient Greco-Roman god Χρόνος (Chronos). This god, in turn, was drawn from theUr-Exampleof the Sassanid sect's Zoroastrian god Zurvan Akarana. He is sometimes described as mute, or may speak in deep leaden tones. He usually wears a deep hood, or less commonly nother over a bare skull. Rarely, he may sometimes wear a crown. In some accounts, you canchallenge him to a game of chess for the right to stay alive.\n\nOften he picks up the characteristics of Charon,The Ferrymanof the river Styx inGreek mythology, but even these characteristics are filtered through aChristian veil, i.e. \"angel of death\". The Grim Reaper, in his days as a frequent figure of folk tales, was originally used as a menacing, somber symbol of the inevitability of death. He first appeared in Western art and folklore with the outbreak of the mid-14th century epidemic called\"The Black Death,\"also known as \"the Plague\".\n\nAs with most folklore-ish characters, he has many and diverse characterizations. He may be sinister or come across asfriendly. He may even be played for laughs as aBeleaguered Bureaucrat. Still other representations of death forgo the neutral or buffoonish guise and make Death aGod of Evilthatmust be fought, i.e.Everyone Hates Hades. Others go the other way and sayDon't Fear the Reaper; instead of evil, he is benevolent.\n\nHis goals can oftentimes be discerned through his tools or weaponry: if it's a large, two-handed implement like aSinister Scytheor a gun withMore Dakka, you're probably dealing with anOmnicidal Maniacwho will cut down lives like fields of wheat; if using smaller sickles or more precision-based weaponry, he's likely to be aiming for a particular target andjust doing his job, and if he's using chains, whomever he's after probably already escaped him once before.\n\nThe Reaper sometimes overlaps or is influenced by the Angel of Death of Biblical scripture, in which case he may explicitly be equated with theArchangel Azrael.\n\nA frequent variation is the notion that instead oftheGrim Reaper, there isaGrim Reaper— that it's a position offered to certain people after they die.\n\nWhen this concept was imported to Japan in the 19th century, they translated the name asShinigami(while typically translated as \"god of death\", it is literally \"deathkami\", which doesn't have quite the same connotations). Japanese media then proceeded to play with the character to the point that manyshinigamino longer have anything in common with the Grim Reaper, aside from the name.Shinigamiare more typically spirits associated with death, rather than being the singularAnthropomorphic Personificationthereof. Thus, the concept of being able to defeat or kill Death in combat (Castlevania) or Grim Reaper figures themselves being able to die (Death Note) can seem absurd to Western viewers. If somethingdoestake down the Reaper, you may haveThe Death of Deathon your hands.\n\nA subtrope ofPsychopomp. May overlap withDestroyer Deityif they're not separate entities. Compare toHorsemen of the Apocalypse— for when the rest show up — andAfterlife Express— when the Grim Reaper is or rides on a vehicle, especially a train.

As with most public services, expecthilarity to ensueifDeath Takes a Holiday, unless someone steps up to the task ofRelieving the Reaper. A kinder interpretation may portray him asThe Sacred Darkness. May overlap withGod of the Dead, and the latter figures often draw inspiration from the Reaper's visual motifs.Examples:open/close all folders\n\nAdvertisingAn American Home Shield commercialhas the Grim Reaper visiting a woman (Laura Baggett), thinking her time is up, but is actually there for the refrigerator, explaining that appliances die at some point. This exchange makes it even funnier:Woman:What, the refrigerator?!Oh, come on!Do you know how much this cost me?!You're killing me!(Grim Reaper then moves towards her)Woman:Let me rephrase that!Australia had a landmark 1987 AIDS education ad which portrayed the Reaper going bowling...with people as pins.An ad for an SUV portrayed driving it as so much fun it filled even Death with the joy of life: he's first seen looming over a baby bird...which he picks up and gently replaces in the nest from which it'd fallen.ThePSA\"dark and lonely water\"featuresDonald Pleasencedressed up as Death (\"the spirit of dark and lonely water\"), who then proceeds to monologue about the children who he's here to reap.Another advertisement featured the grim reaper getting kicked out of a houseHome Alone-style by the sameCool Old Guyhe wanted to take. The reaper had no idea the Cool Old Guy had just bought some handy tools from the company the ad was advertising, and used them to boobytrap the entire house.There was aPSAshown in theaters that warned about the dangers of trains, showing a nervous man playing cards with the Grim Reaper interspersed with a car racing to a road/railroad crossing. It ends with the man crushed, the Reaper laughing, and the car getting nailed by the train. The title card at the end said \"Why gamble with Death?\" Yes,title card: thisPSAwas filmed in the era ofSilent Films.In New Zealand's\"Wheel of Misfortune\"PSA, Death is a carnie sitting at a traffic intersection next to a wheel with alternating slots for \"near miss\", \"minor crash\", \"major crash\", and \"death\" (and, in a single teeny-tiny slot, \"miracle\"). Every time someone makes a stupid decision, he puts his hand on the wheel and gives it a spin.A UK advert for afinancial planningcompany has a man on a train get a warning that he should make some changes to his lifestyle.Another UK advert aimed at soldiers returning from duty features the Grim Reaper — here he is portrayed as a 20-something man who is dressed in black modern clothes, is foul-mouthed and smokes cigarettes. In the advert, he first shows an elderly woman who has died and an obese man who is going to die and collapse after overdoing it while exercising. The advert then cuts to Iraq with a young British soldier called Tommy who later survives and comes back home, with the Grim Reaper stating how Tommy has got into the mindset that he is \"indestructible\", as he has survived Iraq. After watching him nearly have a collision with another driver (a woman with a baby) due to being on his mobile while driving (the grim reaper is unseen by Tommy or anyone else), the scene then cuts to later that evening when Tommy is out with his mates after drinking at the pub. Driving away with the music blaring, the Grim Reaper shouts \"You're gonna die!\" Moments later, the car veers off the road and smashes into a tree. As Death looks at the aftermath of the impact, he sees Tommy now dead on the ground and states, \"Turns out he wasn't so indestructible after all.\" Checking out the wreck, one of Tommy's mates is still alive. The Grim Reaper states he will have to live out the rest of his life in a Wheelchair — \"although it's better than nothing\". Leaning against the wreck, he then looks at the camera and breaks the fourth wall, stating, \"What about you? Fancy your chances?\" The advert then warns that soldiers are twice as likely to have an accident as civilians, adding, \"You may be tough, but you're not indestructible.\"Played for laughs inthis beer commercial.The protagonist fails to die even after having a bike accident and getting hit by a car, a meteor, and lightning...because the Grim Reaper is having a beer.Inthis commercialforEnergizer batteries, the Grim Reaper stops by the Energizer Bunny's house to claim his soul. Being the mascot for a long-lasting battery company, the Bunny shuts the door on him.

Eventually, it is revealed that the Bunny is having a party in his house, and the Grim Reaperleaves when he realizes the Bunny won't tire down anytime soon.There was once a roller coaster at Kennywood Park in Pittsburgh, PA called the \"Steel Phantom\", whose mascot was the Grim Reaper. It was torn down, supposedly for being extremely dangerous. When a new coaster, \"the Phantom's Revenge\", was being built in its place, there were commercials featuringthe Grim Reaper going tanning and generally relaxing, waiting to go back to work.\n\nAnime & MangaBlack Butlerhas more than one Grim Reaper appear throughout the show, though they aren't what you'd expect. They are almost allBishōnenmales who wear (andneed) glasses and wield odd weapons such aschainsaws(Grell) or alawnmower(Ronald Knox). All Reapers were originallyhumans who wereDriven to Suicide.Bleach: The true form of Baraggan Louisenbairn, the Segunda Espada and the former king of Hueco Mundo, is a skeleton wrapped in a dark purple cloak, who wields a giant axe for a weapon and can kill people viaRapid Aging-inducingBattle Aura.Fairy Tail:Erigor from a dark guild Eisenwald wears black hood, wieldsSinister Scythe, known for only taking assassination mission and is called “Death God”.Bloodman of theSpriggan Twelvefits this trope even more so than Erigor, being aRed and Black and Evil All OverIn the HoodEtherious Demon, who’s introduced mopping the floor with Blue Pegasus and Saber Tooth, before crucifying the survivors of his assault to humiliate them. Bonus points: hisRed Barontitle is “God of Death”/“Grim Reaper”.GaoGaiGar FINAL: Pia Decem wears dark armor, has a black cape, makes an ominous sound, uses a deadly scythe, and is sometimes called \"Shinigami\".Hell Teacher Nube: Death shows up to claim Nube halfway through the manga. She's a cute, cheerful girl dressed in a black robe with skull motifs,huge glasses, with a taste for parfaits and confectioneries... and a huge scythe.Hetalia: Axis Powers: The Grim Reaper is the cloaked, silent, skeletal form at England's bedside. He is moved to tears by England's \"last words\" (or his inability to finish them) to America.England doesn't die.High School D×Dfeatures a wholeraceof Grim Reapers, just as there are devils and angels as races. They inhabit a subspace of the Underworld that's inherently hostile to all life. Few members of the race are known, but the top-tier members like Hades, Orcus, and Thanatos, are noted to be on a par withgods. The most visible member of the race is a human/Grim Reaper hybrid named Bennia Orcus (a daughter of the aforementioned): currently part ofIssei's retinue.JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Death Thirteen is a robed Stand wielding aSinister Scythethatattacks people in their dreams, where they are powerless to defend themselves...unless they happen to have fallen asleep while their own Stand was active.Mobile Suit Gundam Wing: The Grim Reaper is a motif on Duo's Deathscythe. He also calls himself aShinigami, although he actually isn't one (just a human being whoalways seems to lose everyone he cares about).Deathscythe Hellmore closely resembles a Grim Reaper by gaining a robe-like armor plating that also functions as camouflage, allowing Duo to sneak up on his enemies unseen right before killing them.Monster Musume: Lala is aDullahanwho dresses and acts like a Grim Reaper while talking in overly melodramatic tones. Only it turns out that she actuallyisa Grim Reaper who's pretending to be a gothy teenager who's pretending to be a Grim Reaper.Murder Princess: Dominikov is ashinigamiwho resembles a diminutive skeleton carrying a large scythe and isable to conjure a spirit-powered motorcycle in a medieval setting. Amazingly for a manga, he actually reaps souls frequently, even going out of his way to do so.One Piece:Doc Q is asickly doctorwho's nevertheless a member of one of the most powerful pirate crews in the world. His design clearly invokes the Grim Reaper feel, seeing he's a tall, gaunt man in a black coat, riding a pale (and just as sick) horse, and wielding adouble-endedSinister Scythe. Even his moniker is'Death God', a Japanese equivalent.Shortly after Zoro defeats King during the Onigashima Raid, he is approached by a skeletal, Grim Reaper-like figure as he collapses from his accumulated injuries and exhaustion. An unnerved Zoro tells the entity to keep away from him, but it swings its scythe at him all the same. Franky finds Zoro unconscious but alive not long after this, and the event has yet to be mentioned again.RIN-NE: Shinigami are the shepherding type. They aid souls tocomplete their businessand move on to the wheel of samsara. Because shinigami have quotas to fill, some shinigami go bad and become known as damshigami instead. Instead of acting as apsychopomp, a damashigami actively leads humans to their death, so as to pad out their quotas. In shinigami society, they are considered criminals.The Heroof the story is Rinne, part human and part shinigami, whose grandmother is a well-respected full-blooded shinigami and whosefatheris a well-respecteddamashigami(well-respected in damashigami circles, that is, making him one of the biggest lowlifes of the entire story). Takuto is also a shinigami, but he's still in training, so his ears and wings aren't real.Soul Eater: Lord Death is your standard-looking Grim Reaper, though with a goofy looking face as not to frighten the students of theExtranormal Institutehe founded. He is also surprisingly badass if you provoke him, even ripping off a powerful Demon's SKIN and sealing said demon in a sack made out of said skin. In a series with manyEquippable Allies, his partner is a scythe. But he also has a hammer, a sniper crossbow that shoots explosives, a guillotine, and amirror. He has a son who's referred to as Death the Kid, who is eventually supposed to succeed him. Worth noting is that while are bothPhysical Gods, it's possible for either one to die,and once Kid gains his full power, Death automatically dies.YuYu Hakusho: Botan is the equivalent of a Grim Reaper...although she doesn't look the part. Or act it. At all. This is because the afterlife in this series is based oneasternmythology, and Botan adheres to this motif: wearing a formal kimono and riding an oar which symbolizes the boats that carry departed souls to the afterlife.Zombie Loan: The Grim Reaper is a menacing figure who, when his soul/core is stolen, turns into a chibi that no one feels threatened by. Anincredibly adorable(and irritable) chibi, who pokes anyone whosuccumbs tothe urge to cuddle himwith his (now tiny) scythe.\n\nArtThe Grim Reaper is commonly depicted on the Death card ofTarot decks(although it represents change rather than death as the end of all things, provided it's right-side-up. If it's upside-down however it really meansGame Over).noteIt has to be said that thereallyunlucky cards, the ones whichreally dohave a strong association with extreme misfortune and even physical death, are in the Minor Arcana, the suit cards. The Ten of Swords is the one to avoid. Its depiction in several suits is of a corpse face-down in a river with ten swords sticking out of its back, which conveys the general underlying theme. Looked at positively, in the full Tarot you only have a one-in-seventy-six chance of drawing this card as opposed to the one-in-twenty-two of getting Death from the Major Arcana only. Of course you could draw Death crossed by the Ten of Swords, which might be interpreted as meaning \"do not make any long-term plans or commitments, as right now there really isn't much point\".Various contemporary descriptions of the images onpirate flags of the early 18th centurymention, among numerous other symbols signifying death and violence, skeletons holdinghourglassesand/or darts—i.e. the Grim Reaper with his traditional attributes.\n\nComic BooksBeasts of Burden: The Black Dog fromdog mythology, shepherdess of the dead who fetches the souls of the departed.Blacksad: Death himself doesn't show up, butFaustLaChapelledons a costume in his image to go around incognito. Death apparently looks like a man with a goat skull in theBlacksaduniverse, merging some of the imagery with that of traditional Western depictions ofSatan.Chicken With Plums:Azrael, the Angel of Death, makes an appearance. Even though he looks dark and demonic (like a shadow with horns), he'sactually a friendly, easygoing guywho talks Nasser Ali out of suicide. He also tells him the folk tale \"Appointment in Samarra\".Chick Tracts: The Grim Reaper makes appearances frequently, usually accompanied by his catchphrase \"Hi there!\"Creepy Magazine: In \"Dead Man's Race\" from issue #54, the last one to be buried in a cemetery becomes that cemetery's ankon until the next burial. With only two more plots in the cemetery and two simultaneous deaths, JasperMacFarlanerushes his dead brother to the cemetery so that he won't be condemned to be an ankon forever. He doesn't do this out of familial affection, but to not burden the family name. Despite driving violently, he fails to arrive before the other family does. Jasper only lets it be because he plans to kill someone and bury them after his brother in secret. He succeeds, but pays for it with his own life. With his brother's grave not yet filled up fully, the townsfolk bury Jasper on top assuming he would've wanted that, unknowingly condemning him to be an eternal ankon.The DCU:Batmanvillain the Reaper wears a costume designed to invoke the imagery of the Grim Reaper: ahoodedBlack Cloak, dark redstudded leather armour,a white skull mask, and a pair ofSinister Scythes.While Nekron (the Lord of the Unliving) doesn't start out as a Grim Reaperper se, he certainly goes to some lengths to evoke this idea inBlackest Night; he even has a scythe and is an awful lot more grim than the average grim reaper.Sogrim, in fact, that where most reapers settle for one soul at a time, or perhaps a city, or maybe a planet if they're feeling up to it, Nekron intends to kill the actual essence of life itself (ironically, this would mean his target is Death of the Endless) — to make life a metaphysical impossibility in his universe. However, Nekron isn't really representative ofdeathso much asthe absence of life.One issueofCaptain Atomfrom the early '90s explained the three as different aspects of Death. Death of the Endless represents \"Death as a Compassionate Release\", the Black Racer represents \"Death as an Inevitability\", and Nekron represents \"Death as The Ultimate Opponent\". However, this fell under a degree ofCanon Discontinuitywith a later issue ofAction Comicswhere Death of the Endless more or less states that Nekron is a bit of a poser.Neil Gaiman's own dissatisfaction with the issue also paints the canonicity of this into doubt.Discussed inDeath: The High Cost of Living. Sexton doesn't believe Didi is the personification of Death, because to him Death is a bone-faced cloaked guy with a scythe who plays chess with Scandinavians.There's a special grim reaper, the Black Flash, specializing inspeedsters(likeThe Flash) who would presumably be too fast to be caught by the normal Death.They've still outrun it occasionally, though. It appears whenever a speedster is about to die.There is also the Black Racer, the Death of theNew Gods. His thing is that he is indeed a god of death and kills people when their time has come.Death as seen in the universe ofThe Sandman (1989)is one of the Endless. She's a pretty andfriendlyPerky Goth, and is the ultimate personification of death in the DC universe, trumping, according to theauthor, everyone else. Accordingly, she is the last thing any person ever sees. Her dissimilarity to traditional concepts of death is constantly beinglampshaded. In the Season of Mists arc, after her big brother Destiny tells her she should be more formally dressed for a family meeting, she balks, saying that next he'll be \"moaning that [she] ought to get a scythe\" after the manner of a traditional Grim Reaper. InThe Thessaliadspinoff series, the character Fetch complains that \"Death should be bones and black robes and scythes\", to which his cohort Thessaly replies \"Maybe she wants to make sure everyone is guaranteed at least one hot date before they cease to exist\". In the spin-offDeath: At Death's Doorby Jill Thompson,Hell closes, sending all its inhabitants to various places, and some of them end up in Death's realm because she's familiar. A being asks who Death is, and she introduces herself as such. Cue him being unimpressed and commenting, \"Sure, you and all the other goth chicks that choked on their own vomit.\".She then shifts to wearing a large billowy cloak and hood decked out in skulls, chains, and a huge scythe.He then believes her.

He refused to go with her and recovered from his illness at the end of the issue. The coverdepicts this Death as a traditional Grim Reaper.Marvel Universe:Death is one of several personifications of abstract concepts present in the setting. She has even been killed off herself, twice — both times with disastrous results. Death appears in a classic black robe, but she wields no scythe. Most beings who encounter her see her with a skull-head, but for those who get intimately entangled with her (particularlyThanos), she can wear a pale young woman's face.Deadpool: Deadpool is in love with her. Thanos loves her as well, however, and cursed Deadpool with immortality so he couldn't steal his girl. Or at least,that's Deadpool's story.Earth X: Death was destroyed by the Ultimate Nullifier at the end ofUniverse X, freeing the dead to travel to a new heavenly dimension — but dooming the living to suffer eternally if mortally wounded. Much of the plot ofParadise Xrevolves around finding a replacement Death, then dealing with the chaos when Jude doesn't restrict himself to people who are supposed to have died.The Infinity Gauntletincludes the archetypal Thanos-Death romance. Thanos's romantic intentions are thwarted when wielding the Gauntlet makes him more powerful than her, and neither of them can be satisfied with an unequal partnership.Jane Foster: Valkyrie: Jane leads a team of medically-themed heroes to save a gravely-ill Death. Jane has to justify doing so, and she independently deduces the premise fromThe Thanos Imperative: that a universe without Death is doomed to develop into a horrific Cancerverse.Secret Wars II: During the second crossover, the Beyonder killed her, but was convinced that life was meaningless without death, and restored her to existence.The Thanos Imperativeis about a universe where Death was killed, turning the universe into an undyingCosmic Horror Story. Then they find the main Marvel universe.In addition to Death herself, psychopomps show up as well, apparently working for Oblivion, another abstract entity and \"brother\" to Death. Deathurge was one of these, until he lost a fight with his childhood friendMr Immortal; the post is then offered to Doorman.Fred Hembeck Destroys the Marvel Universe: The Grim Reaper is portrayed as having clown hair, wearing orange sneakers and a purple robe with blue spots, and going by the name Crackers. He explains that life is one long, elaborate set-up, and death is the ultimate punchline.Man-Thing: One issue features two humans who had become agents of death. The man views death as commonplace so he appears wearing a simple white button-up shirt and slacks. The woman views death more exotically so when she's \"converted\" she dons a dramatic green garment and has long magenta hair.Marvel's Voices: Wolverine encounters what appears to be a Grim Reaper representing Death in \"Death\", and asks them to take him instead of a dying man.The titular character ofMort the Dead Teenagerspends much of the miniseries interacting with Teen Death, who is Death's adolescent son and specifically serves as a psychopomp for deceased teenagers.Siege: Toward the end,Norman Osbornclaims thatThe Sentryis Death, and it was implied at one point in the precedingDark ReignMyth Arcthat he was the one whobrought the plagues to Egypt. How he fits in the hierarchy of the other various death-related beings is still unexplored.Above all these examples exists a separate aspect of the Living Tribunal simply known as the \"Death of Death\", who represents the death of even the Abstracts/Cosmic Entities. And who tries to decide if Death herself should cease to exist after the concept supposedly loses its meaning thanks to the existence of the Green Door and the Five.Monica's Gang:Penadinho(known in English asBug-a-booo) has comedic versions of many stock horror characters. One of them is The Grim Reaper himself — orherself, as it is a female version, Dona Morte (in English,LadyMcDeath) who is clumsy and is always running after her \"next clients\", since no one wants to die. She also appears in stories of the same author whenever someone mentions death.Nathan Hale's Hazardous Tales: The Specter of Death appears in the third book in the seriesDonner Dinner Party, though his appearance is purely symbolic.Preacher: The Angel of Death expresses disinterest in the position he was assigned to and gives it over to the man who would become the Saint of Killers. The former actually looks like an angel and used a sword, while the latter retains his cowboy appearance from his mortal times and the sword is reforged into twin revolvers for him. Clearly, neither conform to the stereotype. The Saint is specifically given jurisdiction over those who dieviolentdeaths; whether the original Angel of Death still takes those who die natural deaths isn't specified.Pretty Deadlyimports the modern Japanese fantasy-style Shinigami into a Western context — there is one capital-D Death, served by a team of \"Reapers\", most of whom were originally human beings and who each specialise in deaths related to a particular kind of concept, including Vengeance, Cruelty, War, Courage, Grace, and others.

Death's look remains ambiguous; he has \"withered legs\" and a \"withered fist\", which could be an euphemism for the familiar skeletal figure; on the other hand, the poor man does not recognize Death when he first sees him and is not terrified by the stranger.

He is portrayed here as cunning and disliking to be on the losing side of anything. He was, in the story, the creator of theDeathly Hallows. Although it's leftambiguousif the brothers actually met him or if they were just powerful wizards who made the Hallows and the story about him was just something that sprung up to explain their creation.

Satan is also Sin's father.Prayer: The FBI agent Gill Martin comes up against the Church of Izrael, led by the seemingly genuine Pastor Nelson van der Velden. He soon realises the odd spelling of \"Izrael\" is no error or eccentricity. Van der Velden spent time in Israel learning the inner secrets of Kabbalah. These include how to actively pray for the death of dirty godless liberals, atheists, socialists and advocates of sexual deviancy, so as to bring about God's will for the USA — a fundamentalist Christian theocracy.

Phipps, the Grim Reaper is aPerky Gothsimilar to Sandman but a good deal more serious as it is her job to cover for the failures of her fellow Primals that rule the multiverse.

He appears as the classic hooded skeleton withglowing blue eye sockets, and wields a scythe so sharp it can slice apart sounds; when he comes for royalty, he uses a sword. He always speaksin small capsto represent\"a voice like lead slabs falling on a marble floor\". Death is one of the most likable and sympathetic characters in the series, to the extent thatfans have expressed their hopes that he's like the one in the novels. (Pratchett received a lot of fanmail to this effect, which often made for... difficult reading.)

When he returned, Death recalled all of them... except for the Death of Rats; it's a lonely, eternal job, and it's nice to have an alternate perspective sometimes. (Also the Death of Fleas, but nobody cares about him.) The Death of Rats itself briefly considered taking form as a terrier and a block of poisoned cheese, but settled for looking just like regular Death, but with a rat skeleton instead of a human one. It also speaks in small caps like the big guy. In addition to rats per se, he comes for most rodents (he has to handle a lot of gifted hamsters after Hogswatch night) as well as ratcatchers and occasionally others of \"ratty\" dispositions. He's sometimes called \"the Grim Squeaker\", although the intelligent rats of the Clan refer to him mainly as the Bone Rat.Squeak.Death's boss isAzrael, the Death of Universes, a being so colossal that galaxies appear as twinkles in his eye.

Reaper, not for his own life but for the lives of a busful of schoolchildren caught in a severe storm. All the questions Death get have answers involving \"death\"; when Benson accuses him of cheating, he denies it, saying that \"you have often heard it said, 'He cheated Death,' but no one ever said 'Death cheatedhim!\"Big Wolf on Campushad two episodes that involved the Grim Reaper. Naturally, everything is parodied hilariously. When a character tries to save his own life by challenging Death to a game of chess, he loses, so then they playYahtzee!, and he loses, so they playConnect Four, and he loses, so they playCluedo. Death was not up for playingStrategoat that point. Also, in the other episode, Death has agreed to leave, but as he walks out the door he turns and starts to deliver his classic \"In time all will come to...\" speech only to have the door slammed in his face...because, you know, they're teenagers, they don't want to hear about that sort of stuff.Charmed (1998): The Angel of Death appears several times, played in all but one instance by the same actor. He's depicted as unstoppable, anyone who falls onto his list will die, and the episode involvescharacters learningto accept that death is inevitable.Cirque du Soleil: In a horror pastiche episode of the seriesSolstrom, once a hotel has been magically transformed into aHaunted Castle/Hell Hotelhybrid, Death arrives as a guest (i.e., he's taking a holiday). Even though he fits the traditional appearance pictured above, magically signs the register with a skull and crossbones symbol, and has a menacing laugh, he observes the strange hijinks going on rather than interfere with them. By the episode's end, an unlucky guest has perished via choking, and when Death checks out it's with the person's soul following him in a daze. Further playing this for dark humor, the Hotel Owner doesn't seem to recognize Death and treats him like any other guest (well, with everything else that's changed, what's one more bizarre stranger on the premises?).Dead Like Me: Grim Reapers work as a team, and are the first variation of Reapers described; the kind that guide the soul of a deceased person to the afterlife.

They also aren't skeletal, don't use scythes, and hide from normal humans by wearing hats that make them invisible.Grimm: Played with. It's not theGrimReaper, it's theGrimmReaper, and it's not the single avatar of death, it's a group of assassins made up of (comparatively mundane) monsters who use scythes as their weapons and go after Grimms, the mythical creatures of the setting.The Hexer: A Grim Reaper–like figure appears in visions and is thought to be a personification of death that follows Geralt wherever he goes.

Stupid deaths, stupid deaths, hope next time it's not you!Interview with the Vampire (2022): Notliterally, but the vampire Santiago does play this character onstage at theThéâtre des Vampires, and it always ends with him exsanguinating a human victim to death, so the end result is the same as if this person had actually encountered the Grim Reaper.Santiago: [states the person's full name and their hometown]. Death awaits everyone, everywhere. Why not here? Unconscious death is the fate of all mortals. We are conscious death, [person's name]. And that would make you... abride/groom. Do you know what it means to be loved by Death? No pain.Kings: Death appears to King Silas as a pale-skinned woman.

Unlike most of the examples on this page, the Reaper is explicitly female. She closely resembles Al's wife Peggy, who isthe cause of a lot of Al's misery in life. She also alludes to there being multiple Reapers out there, having been one of the six who had to carryElvis Presleyout of the bathroom after he died.Monster Jam:Grave Diggeris the Grim Reaper in monster truck form.

He is one of the fourHorsemen of the Apocalypseand the boss of all the Reapers. While he does not appear as the classical Grim Reaper (skeleton in a black cloak), he is portrayed byJulian Richings, a man with a very skeletal appearance. Death is not actively malicious. He views humanity in much the same way we might view microbes — barely noticeable and utterly insignificant. He also claims to be at least as old and as powerful as God (neither of them can remember who's older anymore), and states that, in the end, he'll reap Him too. He's portrayed as more of a typical Grim Reaper-type being in \"Appointment in Samarra\", which makes it clear that his task is to maintain the natural order. He views the Winchesters as slightly more significant this time around — enough for him to be annoyed at the way they keep coming back from the dead, anyway. He also likes fast food — so much so that when the Winchesters summon and bind him at the beginning of Season 7, their \"please don't kill us on the spot\" bribe is a bag of pickle chips.Death is later revealed to be aGod JobwhenDean kills the first incarnation of Deathwith his own scythe (which Death personally loaned him).

They are tasked with punishing beings who defy death, which includes players who were raised from the dead (which, by the time a campaign enters the sorrowsworn's tier of play, usually means most of them).

Kelemvor's avatar is of a tall man wrapped in black shrouds, wearing an emotionless silver mask. In an exception to the Grim Reaper's usual weapon of choice, Kelemvor prefers a bastard sword, which he used when he was still a human warrior.Kelemvor's now-subordinate predecessor Myrkul plays this up as much as possible.

Partially as a consequence of this, the Eldar formed a sect of warriors called the Dark Reapers, although instead of scythes, they userapid-fire micro-missile launchers. ThefirstDark Reaper, the Phoenix Lord Maugan Ra, instead uses a shuriken cannon (yes, aBFGthat fires shuriken) with a scythe blade on the end of the barrel.

He's not much of a traditional Grim Reaper type, though, as he's not hooded, scythe-wielding, or skeletal (in fact, he's usually rather handsome, although it depends on who's playing him.) He's referred to as \"Der Tod\" (\"Death\", in German); his duets with Elisabeth are seen as life-long flirtations, and the single duet with her son Rudolf can beveryeasily seen asHo Yay. This Death, in fact, \"reaps\" people with a literalKiss of Death. He has a handful of silent accompanying angels to carry away those he reaps. He definitely is meant to be creepy/frightening, but nevertheless attractive — physically and/or in the charismatic sense, especially to people like Elisabeth who courts death and Rudolf who commits suicide — and, originally, a bit androgynous.InJacob Marley's Christmas Carol, the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come is actually the Grim Reaper come to collect Scrooge's soul, and it's only throughMarley'sHeroic Sacrificethat Scrooge is given a second chance at life.InRachel Bloom's one-woman showDeath Let Me Do My Show, Death appears in the form of Bloom's friend and old co-starDavid Hull.\n\nToysMonster Highhas River Styxx, daughter of the Grim Reaper and aReaper In Preparationherself.

Not quite what you'd expect, but how many grim reapers haveyoumet before? Has a particular hatred of cats (you know, nine lives and all that) and related animals (such as catfish), and isn't that fond of squirrels either (since they have as many lives \"as they think they can get away with\").

He has a skeletal theme, only Nito is a giant skeleton wearing armor made out ofmore skeletons. Rather than a scythe, he wields a greatsword made ofeven more skeletons. Nito is a particularly strange case: his title \"The First of the Dead\" can be interpreted several ways, and suggests that Death as a concept existed prior to himself, but he claimed Death as his domain. Despite this, he can be destroyed, and accomplishing this does not eliminate death from the world (or the Curse of Undeath, for that matter).Dark Souls II: The final boss takes the form of a tall figure with aSkull for a Head, seemingly wearing a gown made of closely-knit, twisted skeletons and wielding a large scythe.

He wields a scythe with a rifle for a handle and shoots waves of bullets at the player.

His plans in the game involves instigating a massive civil war between two benevolentRed Shirtarmiesand, at the end of the game, using aKill Satto annihilate the humans from the face of the earth.

Even weirder than the fact thatDeath itself is just chilling on the curbis that the Reaper isn't any more dangerous to run into than a dog or a breakdancer is.Persona:Persona 3, Death comes in several forms:First, there's theSuperboss\"The Reaper,\" who stalks the halls ofTartaruswhiledual-wieldingrevolvers. When he appears,Fuukaannounces \"I sense Death!\" Among the personas, there's Pale Rider, a persona of the Death arcana, as well as the ultimate Death-arcana persona,Thanatos,i.e., the scary sword-wielding thing that bursts out of Orpheus near the beginning of the game.Death, as anAnthropomorphic Personification, also plays a pivotal role in the story, as, due to the machinations behind two attempts to bring aboutThe End of the World as We Know It, he ends up beingsealed inside the main character for ten years, and then incarnated as the heroes' free-spirited classmate Ryoji Mochizuki. Death is an avatar and herald ofNyx, anEldritch Abominationwhose role is to bring about humanity's extinction, though in the end,Ryoji, speaking on behalf of Nyx,expresses relief and gratitudethat the heroes found a way to avert the apocalypse after all.Persona 4: The Reaper is aSuperbosswho can be randomly found in aNew Game Plus(althoughPersona 4 Goldenremoves the requirement for NG+). After opening 20 chests, the player will hear ratting of chains, and the Reaper will appear in a random unopened red chest on that dungeon level.Izanami, the main villain of the game, is a subversion. While she is an undead goddess, she did not actively plan any of the killings, she simply gave people powers and watched what they did with them. And even after watching the ensuing chaos, unlike Nyx or Erebus she doesn't think death is something that humanity craves (though what she does think humanity wants is arguably just as twisted).Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth: The Reaper appears as a high-level F.O.E. in the Clock Tower dungeon.Also, Zen, the mysterious guy you've been helping across the game, turns out to be the human avatar of Chronos, god of time and human concept of the cycle of life and death.Persona 5: The Reaper stalks the halls of the underground Mementos dungeon, forcing lower level parties to move between floors quickly lest they face an untimely death. As in previous games, the monster wears a white bag over its head and long black jacket, to invoke the standard grim reaper black cloaked skull imagery.Persona 5 StrikersThe Reaper is aSuperbossfought after the player completes all other requests that involve rematches with the Palace rulers and fighting powerful Shadows.InPokémon, the Ghost Pokémon Dusknoir is the setting's stand-in for the Grim Reaper as its job is to guide spirits toThe Underworld... by eating them with itsBelly Mouth(and spitting out the body if there is one). Disturbingly,Pokémon Legends: Arceusnotes that on rare occasions it's been known to do this to thenot quite dead.Reality-On-The-Norm: Death is a regular protagonist. He initially arrived to collect the zombie mayor's soul, but then was convinced that working as the mayor's campaign manager was a better job than reaping people and quit his job. Since then he's more or less yet another ordinary citizen of the town.Resident Evil 4: One type of Zealot wears a skull mask and wields a scythe.The TaiwaneseMonopolytype video gameRichman 4has the Grim Reaper as one of the gods which give buffs or debuffs to the characters. Anyone who’s possessed by him has to pay all other player’s rents and have all of the durance of bad events double to them, and worst of all, he last for thirteen days compare to other god’s seven days possession.Romancing SaGa: Death is actually a God and aSuperboss. He makes theFinal Bosslook like a weakling in comparison. (Strangely enough, defeating him increases your alignment with him; also if your alignment with him increases enough; he will assist you in battle by killing any enemy except Undead monsters and certain bosses)Death also takes human form during the Soulgutter quest, teaching you how to seal him away and blesses you to prevent your soul from being taken by Soulgutter.RosenkreuzStilette: One of the bosses is an undead Grim Reaper-like wraith who is actually the spirit of Grolla's grandfather and master, Sir Raimund Seyfarth, better known as the legendary Thanatos. This boss not only wields a blood-red scythe called the Devil Scythe Grassense, but also the legendary Demon Sword Grollschwert, both of which he combines together when he faces the player's character head-on in combat.In the bonus mode Grollschwert where you play as Grolla, Grolla claims Grollschwert after taking Raimund down.RuneScape: Death earned his role by being the first person to die on Gielinor. Guthix, one of the major gods of Gielinor, then took him in as one of theGuardians of Guthix, and appointed him as the guide of souls to Gielinor's underworld. When players die in-game, they are sent to his office, where they can reclaim their items for a fee (except for Ultimate Ironmen, who have the old death pile mechanic for balance reasons). He also plays a major part in the Sliske quest line,which centers around the aftermath of Guthix's assassination by Sliske. Prior to his intergration into the game's lore, he was mostly seen during Halloween events. Also, during the period of the event, he would briefly appear to players when they die. Although he no longer appears to players when they die during the events, they can unlock an animation of Death escorting them away when they die.His first name is Harold.Sacrifice: The final spell of the death god Charnel is, well, \"Death\". It summons a towering cloaked figure with two giant blades for arms, who will indiscriminately and gleefully massacre all and every creature it encounters (regardless of which side it belongs to) until he's killed his fill and vanishes. Death cannot be targeted or damaged by anything, and his duration is measured in \"units killed\":once he's locked on to a unit, that unit is dead. For some reason he will not lay a hand, errr,blade, onthe wizards themselves.Samurai Shodown2: The shadowy image of a Grim Reaper appears over you if you're hit withSNK BossMizuki's control-reversal attack, counting down on his fingers. Once done, or if you're hit with the attack again, he ... just goes away.Scribblenauts: If you write \"Death\" or \"Grim Reaper\", you summon a typical black-cloak scythe-wielding skull-faced grim reaper. He'll attack (and eventually kill) anyone nearby, but this also includes you, meaning you should proceed with caution if you want to use him.Super Scribblenautsremoves his scythe — although he'll still pick one up if you spawn one — and gives him the ability to instantly kill anything with a touch. This includes Maxwell in the playground areas, where he's usually invincible to anything short of a nuke.Shadow Heartshas Fox Face, referred to variously as \"Grim Reaper\" and \"God of Death\". As a more traditional Japanese version of Death, he can be defeated, banished, and eventually destroyed.Shin Megami Tensei:Charon ferries the dead in several earlyShin Megami Tenseigames with his latest appearance inShin Megami Tensei IV, where his line of souls waiting to be ferried has become unmanageably huge, and he's willing to look the other way and return you to the land of the living... for a small fee.All of the Fiends are generally themed around being death. The Pale Rider is notable due to being the embodiment of death, but the others all count, as well. In addition to the aforementioned David, Daisoujou mummified himself, Alice asks people to die for her, Hell Biker is the incarnation of the violence of the Hell's Angels, Matador (who is outright called the Grim Reaper inNocturne) represents death by sport, and Chemtrail embodies death by conspiracies of man.Simonas Requiemhas the titular character, a member of the Purple Cloak Reapers tasked with fighting the undead where she goes around kicking ass with her gigantic scythe. She wears aWhite Mask of Doominstead of having a skull in place of her head unlike other common depictions of the reaper, though.The Sims: The Grim Reaper, a scythe-wielding floating skeleton in a face-obscuring black robe, appears when it's time to take away a character who died. With the appropriate expansion, he also comes for pets (with a rather cute animation). Too many deaths at the same time can result in him getting overworked and needing to relax by watching some TV, or go to the toilet. While he doesn't appear in the base game for1, the first expansion pack adds him, setting the stage for the rest of the series. InThe Sims 2, Sims can be saved from death if another Sim successfully pleads with him and wins a game of \"which hand is their soul in?\" with him; if a pet has a strong bond with its owner, it may also be able to fend off the Reaper for them. He never actually uses his scythe in-game; he instead directs aPillar of Lightto pick up the dead Sim. If your sim is dying of old age and had a good enough life, they'll shake his hand, recive a fruity drink and walk off into the light surrounded by hula girls. A premade sim, Olive Specter, also has memories of erm... whoohooing with Grim. Nervous Subject is rumored to to be Grim's son from this. InThe Sims 3, Sims carrying a Death Flower will present it to him upon dying and he'll be so moved he leaves to take it home and put it in a vase, allowing your Sim to live.Sinjid: The first game has these as mid to late-game enemies, andthe final bossesof both it and the second game are these as well. The ones in the first game have an attack that would instantly kill the player if they failed to attack them in time and were ofteninvisibledue to a glitch,making them needlessly difficult to predict, andthe Shadow of the Reaperhas access to a time bomb thatinstantly kills the player if they fail to kill him in time.They live up to their namesake. TheShadow Reaperin the second game forgoes the strategy of his predecessors in favour ofsoul-stealing attacksand tearing away at the player's defenses instead, and is considered to bemuch easier in comparisondue to his lack ofan unfair gimmick.Skylanders: Two of the Skylanders are based on the Grim Reaper.First is Grim Creeper of theUndeadelement, introduced in the third game,Skylanders: Swap Force. He is essentially a ghost inhabiting armor that he can use to attack enemies, but he also wields a scythe (that seems to be made from his essence, given it's made of the same blue wisps that make up his body) that he can telekinetically control to launch them into the air. Enemies defeated by him are made into ghostly spirits that do his bidding, and his catchphrase is literally \"Your Time is Up!\".Introduced inSkylanders: Trap Teamand made a real Skylander inSkylanders: Imaginatorsis Hood Sickle. He combines the Grim Reaper motif with that of an executioner, wearing the hood of the latter. While his scythe initially started out as an energy scythe, he later switched it for a double-bladed scythe, as in there are steel scythe blades on both ends. While he was initially of the Undead element like Grim Creeper with the ability to summon ghosts to fight alongside him, he becomesDark-elementalin the latter game, gaining the ability to createblack holesthat slow down enemies. Fittingly, his catchphrase is \"Any Last Words?\".Smite:Thanatostakes the role of a Grim Reaper Assassin God with a scythe that can kill extremely wounded Gods instantly. Rather than using a skull for his head, he instead hid his face with an emotionless mask.Sonic Frontiers: The franchise'sGreater-Scope VillainThe Endis a somewhat unusual take on the trope. Its physical appearance depends on its viewer's perception of death, it seeks to destroy any life it comes across, and it claims itself to be a force above any other godlike beings which Sonic previously fought.Soul Nomad & the World Eaters: Each world inThe Multiversehas its Master of Death — a god-like being acting as psychopomp and responsible for maintaining the free flow of souls between life and the afterlife. Of the two you encounter during the game,Gammaand Gig,Gamma is aKnight Templarwho kills off everyone above the age of 30 in his world to keep it from being uglied by old age, and Gig is anOmnicidal Maniacwith apsychotic streakwho turned your world into a slowly dying dustbowl 200 years ago. Neitherlookparticularly like the traditional reaper, being hovering humans withShoulders of Doom. Gig uses a scythe, however. When a certain character from anotherworldstarts talking about challenging the Reaper metaphorically, people point out this doesn't describe Gig very well.As it turns out, Gig (Vigilance) was actually areal nice guybefore Drazil's machinations.Touhou Project:Komachi mixes up the mythologies here. She's aShinigamiwho both uses a scythe and rows a boat across the Sanzu river. Also, she doesn't take her job very seriously and is prone to slacking off. InScarlet Weather Rhapsody, it was explained that she wasn't so much a Grim Reaper as purely an entity akin to Charon, since she's not permitted to reap souls. She's just a ferryman who takes you across the river.The spin-off mangaWild and Horned Hermitintroduces the Kishin, which act closer to the traditional view of the reaper.In the fangameThe Mistress' Heart-Throbbing Adventure: The Cursed Mansion, once Remilia regains the ability to fly, the jewel on the overhead map will flash and gradually turn red; once it does, you'll be forced into a battle against a Grim Reaper. It is the strongest non-boss enemy in the game, and as such you get an in-game achievement for defeating it. Once you either kill it or exit the room, though, the jewel will reset and repeat the process.Twisted Metal: Mister Grimm is actually the Grim Reaper in most incarnations. It was suggested that he was once a mortal man, as statistics given in Twisted Metal Head-On match the form he assumes in his ending, rather than his usual appearance as a skeletal biker. The exception occurs in the darker Twisted Metal Black; unlike the main series, Grimm in this game was a US soldier in Vietnam, who was captured along with a wounded friend. The friend died, and in order to avoid starving to death, Grimm had to eat his corpse, keeping the skull as a mask. The reboot changed him again; this time as the son of a stunt biker, who took his father's stage name after he died in a car accident.The Grim Reaper appears as a boss ofUndead Line, predictably near aNight of the Living Mooksstage. This version of the reaper cancloak the area in darkness to confuse youand shoot balls of dark energy as projectiles, but somehow he lacks the usual depiction of wielding a scythe.Venture Kid: One of theboss fightspitsAndyagainst a grim reaper who attacks with aSinister Scythe.Wonder Boy in Monster Land: Death is the first boss, and later reappears inPalette Swapform as the \"Poor God\" (God of Poverty), who steals your gold when he attacks.The Wonderful 101: The Grim Reaper appears as a minor member of the eponymous superhero team, operating under the code name Wonder-Death.

This is a moniker heembraces, as the crime rate in London has gone down out ofsheer terrorat the thought of incurring the Reaper's wrath.InHatoful Boyfriend, when Hiyoko meets a Bad End a Grim Reaper with a bird skull face appears on the screen. InHoliday Star, a beaked and uniformed train Conductor with aface totally hidden in shadowaside from glowing eyes, takes tickets from dreaming birds (and a human) traversing a train through the stars. The Conductor reappears at the end of the game to shepherd the spirits of dead birds onwards onto the next train, and the living ones (and human) onto a train that will take them back to Earth where they'll wake up. He's gentle and folksy. In a bonus scene Hiyoko asks him to step into the light and he proves to have a bird skull face, and she greets him happily as Mister Death, asthey've known each other since the demo of the first game. Sakuya is flabberghasted. \"She's friends... with Death?\"\n\nWebcomicsThe Adventures of Dr. McNinja: Death is a skeletal maitre d' because Purgatory is a restaurant with bad service.

Of late,the author himself has become Death of Going Back in Time and Killing Yourself, after being on the receiving end but before any inkling of the giving end. One of the perks of the job is... the ability to travel in time.Jack (David Hopkins): The eponymousKiller Rabbitis assigned the job, as well as being theAnthropomorphic Personificationof the sin of Wrath. Interestingly, his first job is punishment for the things he did to get him the second job(namely, genocide of humanity). In spite of his fearsome appearance (seven foot tall, green humanoid rabbit with glowing red eyes, who looks like he's been dead for about two weeks) and his anger issues, he still tries to be a nice guy, especially to children and innocents. The comic is about his coming to terms with and seeking forgiveness for his deeds; perhaps ironically, while he regrets his deeds, he feels that what he has done was unforgivable — and without that, he cannot escape Hell. Unlike at least five of the seven sins, he was never pure evil, but he racked up the highest death count of any of them.The KAMicshas Hela fromNorse Mythologyas its official Grim Reaper (although for a while it seemed to be Steve ofLife and Death).Shedoesn'tdressverytraditionalthough.(Fourth link is NSFW.)She describes her job as a guide for the dead type.Lovefeastis centered around the concept of less-than-normal people giving up their lives to train to become \"death gods\" within a secret society. Inside of that society, they call each otherShinigami. They adopt different death god abilities to not only handle souls of the dead, but also to destroy demons that might interfere with those souls' passing to Purgatory. \"THE\" death god passed away ages before the story takes place and was a shape-shifter himself but sometimes took on the traditional cloaked appearance of the Grim Reaper.Loving Reaper, as an animal abuse PSA comic, focuses on the animal souls rather than the human ones Death collects, usually belonging to victims of humanity's greed and carelessness.

These are just one of the many hundreds and hundreds of examples. However, Thanatos himself is the most powerful and indeed the one in charge of the whole bunch.

The advert then cuts to Iraq with a young British soldier called Tommy who later survives and comes back home, with the Grim Reaper stating how Tommy has got into the mindset that he is \"indestructible\", as he has survived Iraq. After watching him nearly have a collision with another driver (a woman with a baby) due to being on his mobile while driving (the grim reaper is unseen by Tommy or anyone else), the scene then cuts to later that evening when Tommy is out with his mates after drinking at the pub. Driving away with the music blaring, the Grim Reaper shouts \"You're gonna die!\" Moments later, the car veers off the road and smashes into a tree. As Death looks at the aftermath of the impact, he sees Tommy now dead on the ground and states, \"Turns out he wasn't so indestructible after all.\" Checking out the wreck, one of Tommy's mates is still alive. The Grim Reaper states he will have to live out the rest of his life in a Wheelchair — \"although it's better than nothing\". Leaning against the wreck, he then looks at the camera and breaks the fourth wall, stating, \"What about you? Fancy your chances?\" The advert then warns that soldiers are twice as likely to have an accident as civilians, adding, \"You may be tough, but you're not indestructible.\"",

However, Nekron isn't really representative ofdeathso much asthe absence of life.One issueofCaptain Atomfrom the early '90s explained the three as different aspects of Death. Death of the Endless represents \"Death as a Compassionate Release\", the Black Racer represents \"Death as an Inevitability\", and Nekron represents \"Death as The Ultimate Opponent\". However, this fell under a degree ofCanon Discontinuitywith a later issue ofAction Comicswhere Death of the Endless more or less states that Nekron is a bit of a poser.Neil Gaiman's own dissatisfaction with the issue also paints the canonicity of this into doubt.Discussed inDeath: The High Cost of Living. Sexton doesn't believe Didi is the personification of Death, because to him Death is a bone-faced cloaked guy with a scythe who plays chess with Scandinavians.There's a special grim reaper, the Black Flash, specializing inspeedsters(likeThe Flash) who would presumably be too fast to be caught by the normal Death.They've still outrun it occasionally, though. It appears whenever a speedster is about to die.There is also the Black Racer, the Death of theNew Gods. His thing is that he is indeed a god of death and kills people when their time has come.Death as seen in the universe ofThe Sandman (1989)is one of the Endless. She's a pretty andfriendlyPerky Goth, and is the ultimate personification of death in the DC universe, trumping, according to theauthor, everyone else. Accordingly, she is the last thing any person ever sees. Her dissimilarity to traditional concepts of death is constantly beinglampshaded. In the Season of Mists arc, after her big brother Destiny tells her she should be more formally dressed for a family meeting, she balks, saying that next he'll be \"moaning that [she] ought to get a scythe\" after the manner of a traditional Grim Reaper. InThe Thessaliadspinoff series, the character Fetch complains that \"Death should be bones and black robes and scythes\", to which his cohort Thessaly replies \"Maybe she wants to make sure everyone is guaranteed at least one hot date before they cease to exist\". In the spin-offDeath: At Death's Doorby Jill Thompson,Hell closes, sending all its inhabitants to various places, and some of them end up in Death's realm because she's familiar. A being asks who Death is, and she introduces herself as such. Cue him being unimpressed and commenting, \"Sure, you and all the other goth chicks that choked on their own vomit.\".She then shifts to wearing a large billowy cloak and hood decked out in skulls, chains, and a huge scythe.He then believes her. On the subject ofComic Book Deathshe takesthe long view on such matters, reasoning that in the endeveryonedies and if they so happen tomake a few side tripsin the meantime, no skin off her back, she can wait. Besides, they look like they're having so much fun!Lex Luthor:The dead have come back to life! Several of them!Death:It happens! In the end, they all come back to me.The Warlord: Travis Morgan was once visited by a gorgeous Death, asStripperificas any other woman in that series, who invited, \"Come to me, my love!\" and then took him through avisionof his past. He refused to go with her and recovered from his illness at the end of the issue. The coverdepicts this Death as a traditional Grim Reaper.",

      "text": "Marvel Universe:Death is one of several personifications of abstract concepts present in the setting. She has even been killed off herself, twice — both times with disastrous results. Death appears in a classic black robe, but she wields no scythe. Most beings who encounter her see her with a skull-head, but for those who get intimately entangled with her (particularlyThanos), she can wear a pale young woman's face.Deadpool: Deadpool is in love with her. Thanos loves her as well, however, and cursed Deadpool with immortality so he couldn't steal his girl. Or at least,that's Deadpool's story.Earth X: Death was destroyed by the Ultimate Nullifier at the end ofUniverse X, freeing the dead to travel to a new heavenly dimension — but dooming the living to suffer eternally if mortally wounded. Much of the plot ofParadise Xrevolves around finding a replacement Death, then dealing with the chaos when Jude doesn't restrict himself to people who are supposed to have died.The Infinity Gauntletincludes the archetypal Thanos-Death romance. Thanos's romantic intentions are thwarted when wielding the Gauntlet makes him more powerful than her, and neither of them can be satisfied with an unequal partnership.Jane Foster: Valkyrie: Jane leads a team of medically-themed heroes to save a gravely-ill Death. Jane has to justify doing so, and she independently deduces the premise fromThe Thanos Imperative: that a universe without Death is doomed to develop into a horrific Cancerverse.Secret Wars II: During the second crossover, the Beyonder killed her, but was convinced that life was meaningless without death, and restored her to existence.The Thanos Imperativeis about a universe where Death was killed, turning the universe into an undyingCosmic Horror Story. Then they find the main Marvel universe.In addition to Death herself, psychopomps show up as well, apparently working for Oblivion, another abstract entity and \"brother\" to Death. Deathurge was one of these, until he lost a fight with his childhood friendMr Immortal; the post is then offered to Doorman.Fred Hembeck Destroys the Marvel Universe: The Grim Reaper is portrayed as having clown hair, wearing orange sneakers and a purple robe with blue spots, and going by the name Crackers. He explains that life is one long, elaborate set-up, and death is the ultimate punchline.Man-Thing: One issue features two humans who had become agents of death. The man views death as commonplace so he appears wearing a simple white button-up shirt and slacks. The woman views death more exotically so when she's \"converted\" she dons a dramatic green garment and has long magenta hair.Marvel's Voices: Wolverine encounters what appears to be a Grim Reaper representing Death in \"Death\", and asks them to take him instead of a dying man.The titular character ofMort the Dead Teenagerspends much of the miniseries interacting with Teen Death, who is Death's adolescent son and specifically serves as a psychopomp for deceased teenagers.Siege: Toward the end,Norman Osbornclaims thatThe Sentryis Death, and it was implied at one point in the precedingDark ReignMyth Arcthat he was the one whobrought the plagues to Egypt. How he fits in the hierarchy of the other various death-related beings is still unexplored.Above all these examples exists a separate aspect of the Living Tribunal simply known as the \"Death of Death\", who represents the death of even the Abstracts/Cosmic Entities. And who tries to decide if Death herself should cease to exist after the concept supposedly loses its meaning thanks to the existence of the Green Door and the Five.",

He appears as the classic hooded skeleton withglowing blue eye sockets, and wields a scythe so sharp it can slice apart sounds; when he comes for royalty, he uses a sword. He always speaksin small capsto represent\"a voice like lead slabs falling on a marble floor\". Death is one of the most likable and sympathetic characters in the series, to the extent thatfans have expressed their hopes that he's like the one in the novels. (Pratchett received a lot of fanmail to this effect, which often made for... difficult reading.) The scales were tipped when Sir Terry revealed he had been diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's Disease, so Death would be coming forhimsoon. His passing was marked by an official Tweet in the appropriate typeface.At last, Sir Terry, we must walk together.Terry took Death's arm and followed him through the doors and on to the black desert under the endless night.The End.Although Death is largely a nice person, youreallydon't want to get him mad. The Auditors of Reality have discovered this several times over, and a good guy like the titular protagonist ofMortcan get on his bad side with near-fatal results.Death performs his duty for every living thing on the Disc, but his brief retirement inReaper Manleft a void that was filled with a separate Death for every creature, each taking the appearance of something related to what its targets associate with mortality: the Death of Mayflies was a black-scaled trout, the Death of Trees a disembodied chopping noise, and the malevolent,Witch King-like Death of Humans took the form of a robe over formless darkness, bearing a crown and coming for his targets at the strike of midnight. When he returned, Death recalled all of them... except for the Death of Rats; it's a lonely, eternal job, and it's nice to have an alternate perspective sometimes. (Also the Death of Fleas, but nobody cares about him.) The Death of Rats itself briefly considered taking form as a terrier and a block of poisoned cheese, but settled for looking just like regular Death, but with a rat skeleton instead of a human one. It also speaks in small caps like the big guy. In addition to rats per se, he comes for most rodents (he has to handle a lot of gifted hamsters after Hogswatch night) as well as ratcatchers and occasionally others of \"ratty\" dispositions. He's sometimes called \"the Grim Squeaker\", although the intelligent rats of the Clan refer to him mainly as the Bone Rat.Squeak.Death's boss isAzrael, the Death of Universes, a being so colossal that galaxies appear as twinkles in his eye. It takes a whole page to contain a single-word reply to a question. He has a clock —theclock — which tells Time whatitis.Nationfeatures aTrue Neutralversion of Death called Locahawho may or may not exist.",

He is one of the fourHorsemen of the Apocalypseand the boss of all the Reapers. While he does not appear as the classical Grim Reaper (skeleton in a black cloak), he is portrayed byJulian Richings, a man with a very skeletal appearance. Death is not actively malicious. He views humanity in much the same way we might view microbes — barely noticeable and utterly insignificant. He also claims to be at least as old and as powerful as God (neither of them can remember who's older anymore), and states that, in the end, he'll reap Him too. He's portrayed as more of a typical Grim Reaper-type being in \"Appointment in Samarra\", which makes it clear that his task is to maintain the natural order. He views the Winchesters as slightly more significant this time around — enough for him to be annoyed at the way they keep coming back from the dead, anyway. He also likes fast food — so much so that when the Winchesters summon and bind him at the beginning of Season 7, their \"please don't kill us on the spot\" bribe is a bag of pickle chips.Death is later revealed to be aGod JobwhenDean kills the first incarnation of Deathwith his own scythe (which Death personally loaned him). The next Reaper in line who dies automatically becomes the new Death, which turns out to be a Reaper who goes by the alias Billie.

He is known as the Angel of Destruction and Rebirth.In Christianity, Azrael is neither canonical nor noncanoical due to not being referenced by any major or apocryphal Christian text. However,The Biblementionsan angel who is either associated with Jesus, or Jesus himself (son of man),wielding a scythe ready to reap the grapes of wrath,symbolizing the killing of all of the earth dwellers who martyred all of the Christians.He's definitely identified in the Book of Revelation as one of theHorsemen of the Apocalypse, and in fact the only one to be explicitly named.Islam holds him in the highest esteem out of three faiths, referring to him as an archangel. Transcribed as \"Azrāʾīl\" in Arabic, he is one of the four angels alongside Isrāfīl (taking the place of Raphael) and Michael and Gabriel. He collects the departed souls from the bodies and is told by God when their time is. Additionally, according to Islamic lore, forty days before the death of a person approaches, God drops a leaf from a tree below the heavenly throne, on which Azrael reads the name of the person he must take with him.",

(In fifth edition, it instead summons a dread wraith, a powerful undead creature which sort of looks like the grim reaper.)4th Edition features an entire race of Grim Reapers, the sorrowsworn, who answer to the Raven Queen, the goddess of death and fate in. They are tasked with punishing beings who defy death, which includes players who were raised from the dead (which, by the time a campaign enters the sorrowsworn's tier of play, usually means most of them). They resemble dark angelic beings and their middle tier, called Reapers, wield scythes that deal psychic damage. 5th Edition largely reinvents them into demonic beings who feed on negative emotions.Eberron: Clerics of the Sovereign Host/Dark Six's god of death, the Keeper, have scythes as their favoured weapon.Forgotten Realms:TheLawful NeutralGod of the Dead, Kelemvor, can dispatch any creature he likes to do his work, and Kelemvor himself occasionally comes in person. Kelemvor's avatar is of a tall man wrapped in black shrouds, wearing an emotionless silver mask. In an exception to the Grim Reaper's usual weapon of choice, Kelemvor prefers a bastard sword, which he used when he was still a human warrior.Kelemvor's now-subordinate predecessor Myrkul plays this up as much as possible. He wields a scythe and manifests as a skeleton in black robes, occasionally showing up to funeralsjust to be a dick and scare people.Ravenloft:Grim reapers aren't minions of a death deity as far as anyone knows: they just like to kill stuff.The darklord Death believes itself to be the real thing. It's not; in reality, it was once the mortal servant of another darklord, transformed by his mad experiments into a unique undead being.Greyhawk: Nerull the Reaper is a god of death resembling a rust-red skeleton wearing a dull black cloak, and wields a \"sablewood staff from which projects a scarlet blade of force that has the power to slay any creature\". Nerull's clerics are serial killers. In 3rd Edition, he's opposed by Wee Jas, aLawful Neutraldeity of death and magic who doesn't agree with him on the\"kill everything that breathes\"subject.",

Death is an avatar and herald ofNyx, anEldritch Abominationwhose role is to bring about humanity's extinction, though in the end,Ryoji, speaking on behalf of Nyx,expresses relief and gratitudethat the heroes found a way to avert the apocalypse after all.Persona 4: The Reaper is aSuperbosswho can be randomly found in aNew Game Plus(althoughPersona 4 Goldenremoves the requirement for NG+). After opening 20 chests, the player will hear ratting of chains, and the Reaper will appear in a random unopened red chest on that dungeon level.Izanami, the main villain of the game, is a subversion. While she is an undead goddess, she did not actively plan any of the killings, she simply gave people powers and watched what they did with them. And even after watching the ensuing chaos, unlike Nyx or Erebus she doesn't think death is something that humanity craves (though what she does think humanity wants is arguably just as twisted).Persona Q: Shadow of the Labyrinth: The Reaper appears as a high-level F.O.E. in the Clock Tower dungeon.Also, Zen, the mysterious guy you've been helping across the game, turns out to be the human avatar of Chronos, god of time and human concept of the cycle of life and death.Persona 5: The Reaper stalks the halls of the underground Mementos dungeon, forcing lower level parties to move between floors quickly lest they face an untimely death. As in previous games, the monster wears a white bag over its head and long black jacket, to invoke the standard grim reaper black cloaked skull imagery.Persona 5 StrikersThe Reaper is aSuperbossfought after the player completes all other requests that involve rematches with the Palace rulers and fighting powerful Shadows.",
