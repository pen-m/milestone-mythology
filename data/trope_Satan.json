  "description": "\"The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous [...]Well may proceed from him all tribulation.\"—Inferno, canto 34\n\nWhat matter where, if I be still the same,And what I should be, all but less than heWhom Thunder hath made greater? Here at leastWe shall be free; the Almighty hath not builtHere for his envy, will not drive us hence:Here we may reign secure, and in my choiceTo reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:Better to reign in Hell, than serve in Heaven.—Satan, Book I,Paradise Lost\n\nSatan is theGreater-Scope VillainorBig Badof most varieties ofChristianityandIslam(and by extension, of any work of fiction in which one of those religions is confirmed to be true), and a fair amount of fiction with religious influences, and other religions have similar variants. Traditionally, he is the single most evil being in existence, period.\n\nKnown also as... Helel (supposedly his original angelic name, which in Hebrew literally means\"shining one\"and metaphorically means \"morning star\") or Lucifer (Latin translation for the word Helel, which literally means \"light bringer\"), Samael (another angelic name often attributed to him, Hebrew for\"Poison of God\"),Beelzebub(Hebrew for \"Lord of Flies\"),Iblis, the Father of Lies,the Prince of Darkness, \"the Other Guy\", Old Scratch, Old Nick, the Quare Fellow,Lucifer Morningstar,Spooky Electric,Basement Cat... or simply the Devil. Alsohas a number, which is666. Should you encounter someone with any of these names,run away.noteThough the authenticity for some of these names for Satan is still a subject to debate to this day.\n\nSatan's backstory casts him as aFallen Angel, originally thelight-bearingarchangelofHeaven, who is damned to spend eternity inHell(eventually, at least) due to his rebellion againstGod. By virtue of his once-grand celestial position, Satan is often depicted as the ruler of Hell and the demons that dwell there, even if he's as much a prisoner there as any of the damned. This backstory is derived from theBook of RevelationinThe Bible.\n\nNo matter what version of Satan is employed, he is usually ashapeshifter, capable of taking any form — physical or not — that he cares to. In human form, he is often shown withredorblondhair. His true form is often that of aBig Red Devil, or perhaps asnakeordragon. His weapon of choice is oftena tridentor a similar instrument. All things that hide or distort the truth are in his province, making him also the master of deception and illusion. Consequently, his most common incarnations are wheeler-dealers, bargainers, and con-men.\n\nDue to this, Satan is frequently used to represent any threat (real or perceived) to a community's stability and its moral integrity, often appearing as anUnreliable Narratorwho seeks to trick mortals into thinking that sin, various vices, and other \"evil\" beliefs and deeds are in fact harmless, or evengood all along despite what God wants them to think. Far too often, however, he tends to be used as astrawmanbyMoral Guardiansfor the purpose of invokingHitler Ate Sugar, whether claiming that any opinions they consider subversive of the social orderare evil and wrong by defaultbecause Satan supposedly put them in the troublemaker's head (even when they aren't actually wrong in themselves), ordemonizingwhatever hobby of yours they don't like by claiming they are Satanic because he isinvolved in them.noteOr maybe this is what he wants you to think...Rock & Roll,drugs,new media,homosexuality, any foreign culture with a different set of values thatgoes against the Moral Guardians' beliefs, and generallyany new fad that becomes popular among youngstersare especially prone to this, while theEveryone Is Satan in Hellphenomenon practically runs on it.\n\nDespite an overwhelming overconfidence (he represents theDeadly SinofPride, after all), he almost always possesses a keen sense of enlightened self-interest. In keeping with the belief of the \"most beautiful angel\" who fell, Satan takes a handsome face whenever possible, but behind it is often rage and hatred; tearing away that mask, either intentionally or not, is possibly one of the most suicidal things a character can do.\n\nIn his more modern incarnations, he is often acharmingMan of Wealth and Tastewith a taste for the offerings of humanity's cultural achievements, fromwineto music to poetry and stories. His interpretations do not always accord with the official ones. Despite this however, Satan is usually shown — for all his enjoyment of the finer things — to have a pathological hatred of humanity, blaming them for stealing the rightful place of the angels as God's children.\n\nOne of his favorite ploys (it's at leastOlder Than Steam, as seen inFaustand earlier) is to essentially grant one or more wishes in exchange for the wisher's soul. It's a classiclopsided deal in the Devil's favor— short-term corporeal gain in exchange for long-term infernal torment. This is almost always handled via a physical contract which is usually composed entirely oftortuous legalese. Single wishes are almost always handledLiteral Geniestyle, if notperverted outright. In some versions of the story the contracted victim may be able to free himself via a redemptive act or the intervention of God; in modern takes, especiallySuper Herocomics, the hero may take revenge against the Devil via aFaustian Rebellion. In any case, his goal is to lure as many souls to his side as possible, making him an example ofThe Corrupter.\n\nIn recent depictions, Satan is sometimes subverted by giving him an unexpected soft spot that renders him a bit more \"human\" and less supernatural—he likes kittens, or snowcones for example. It doesn't make him any less dangerous (if he's dangerous at all); it just lets the audience think they understand him.\n\nAnother common plot revolves around Satan's son, presumed to beThe Antichrist. Some common subversions are that this child'sjust a normal person, or that he'ssmoking hot.\n\nSatan is traditionally associated with a host ofarchdemonic sidekicks, among the best known of which areAsmodeus, Azazel,Baal,Baphomet,Beelzebub, Belial,Mammon,Mephistopheles, Moloch,andLilith. These are sometimes seen as servants of Satan (often with more effective power over humans, presumably because their actions are not so closely watched), but are also (with the obvious exception of Lilith) often conflated into alternate names for the same being. Most of these names, as with \"Lucifer\", derive from supernatural figures from pre-Jewish beliefs in the Middle East, who werechanged into devilsas the new Abrahamic faiths took over.\n\nTo learn more about the history of Satan, visit theAnalysis page.\n\nRelated to Satan is theSatanic Archetype, which is a (usually) original character explicitly modeled after him. They tend to have features such as being the lord of all evil in the world, rebelling against the supreme deity they served or the celestial beings that they were once a part of, or leading some race of demons or other evil creatures. If a series revolves around gods and goddesses, usually there will be one cast as a Satan figure in spite of how they were portrayed in the original mythology; this is a phenomenon calledHijacked by Jesus. This is whyEverybody Hates Hadesfrom theGreco-Roman pantheon, because he is assumed to be like Satan.\n\nA common twist is thatSatan Is Good,a victim of propaganda; this often goes hand-in-hand withGod Is Evil. Of course, sometimesGod and Satan Are Both Jerks. A common portrayal in Western Media is also to cast Satan asThe Anti-God, asGod'sEvil Counterpart, in contrast to most Christian theology, where Satan is a far lesser being than God. It has also become popular toportray the Devil without any reference to God.\n\nHe is generally the leader ofThe Legions of Helland is an essential component of aFire and Brimstone Hell. When hiding under an alias, usually a pretty transparent one, this becomesLouis Cypher. If there's more than one, we're talking aboutDemon Lords and Archdevils. You might be interested in his brothers as well,Archangel Michael,Archangel Gabriel,Archangel Raphael, andArchangel Uriel.\n\nFor when Satan rocks out, seeRock Me, Asmodeus!. If Satan threatens heteronormative gender roles in addition to your soul by being aSissy Villain,Camp Gay, or aCreepy Crossdresser, seeFlaming Devil.\n\nRemember, this trope is about the use of Satan as aPublic Domain Character. If the character shares several significant features with him but isn't at least implied to be the Abrahamic Devil, they go underSatanic Archetype. If the character claims to be Satan when they literally are not, then it's a case ofDevil Complex.Examples:open/close all folders\n\nAnime and MangaAh! My Goddesshad Hild, the CEO of Hell. She's the mother to Belldandy's half-sister Urd. Their father is God.An important part of the plot ofAngel Sanctuaryis the attempts by high demons to resurrect Lucifer. His generals are called the Satans and all bear names such as Asmodeus, Belial, Astaroth etc. Lucifer himself is actually on the good side, in the end—although he does do a lot of crap.The manga version ofBastard!! (1988)eventually brings in Christian cosmology, with angels, devils, etc. The main character, Dark Schneider, has been known to fight against both. Satan himself makes a major appearance, and is hinted at being the eventualBig Bad. Interestingly, Satan and Lucifer are two separate beings in the story.InBeelzebub, Satan and Lucifer are two distinctly different beings (Satan's appearance being depicted as that of a young male, Lucifer's being that of a little girl), but are part of the same group of demons—the Seven Sin Lords, who were the rulers of distinct kingdoms in the Demon World before it was united under Baby Beel's father, the Demon King aka Beelzebub III. Beel is also part of this group, being the latest demon to inherit the name \"Beelzebub.\"Both Satan and Lucifer are contracted to the two strongest members of the Ishiyama Upstarts, Fuji and Takamiya, in opposition of Oga and Beel, with the entire conflict risking the possibility of a new war erupting in the Demon World. While Takamiya has been defeated and allied with Oga, Fuji has proven himself to be uncontrollable and a dangerous threat, causing anEnemy Minewith the entire school standing against him as he begins petrifying everyone.Satan himself appears a few times inBlue Exorcist, always while possessing someone (he's far too powerful to manifest in the human realm). He's a completeJerkasswhoswears like no tomorrowand kills random peoplejust for the hell of it,laughing all the while. Near the end of the series, the reason for his hatred against humans is revealed:he was completely ignorant to many things including the very concept of mortality until he encountered aPlucky Girlwho not only didn't fear him but was immune to his flames and willingly invited him to possess her body, saying that he must be lonely to have everything he touch burn to ashes. Over the next year, she explained to him the concept of life. When Satan stated he wanted to live, Yuri's response was that life cannot be taken or given, only created.You know the result...Naturally, the Church freaked outbig timeandtried to burn her at the stakebefore she gives birth, dismissing her claims that demons areMirroring Factionsas blasphemy. Cue Satanpossessing every powerful exorcist he could reachto find a host body he could save her with, ultimately succeeding but not without killing hundreds in the process. Yuridied from childbirthandSatan swore to take revengebymerging the human and demon worlds into one.Love Makes You Crazy, much? Too bad the next person he possessed and hadDriven to SuicidewasFujimoto, the very same man who went against orders to raise Satan's sons in secrecy; Rin, one of said sons,promptly decided to kick daddy's ass. Should be noted that everything in the spoilers is an anime-only thing. So far, the manga hasn't come clear with his true goal and motives. Rin still wants to kick his ass though.While he'snever made a direct appearance, Lucifer is mentioned inA Certain Magical Indexseveral times by members of the Roman Catholic Church when discussing the Archangels. In the Index-verse, whereangels have no free will of their own and that they are meant to be God's perfect tools, and are often referred as messengers of God to humanity, Lucifer and hisFallen Angelbrethren are notable for \"malfunctioning\" and gaining wills of their own, which caused their rebellion against God and ultimately being cast down byArchangel Michael. It's noted that before this Lucifer had the unique position as \"The Right Seat of God,\" which paradoxically made him God's equal despite being an angeland serves as part of the inspiration for Fiamma of God's Right Seat's goal to becomeLa Persona Superiore a Dio(The One Above God).InDevilmanRyo Asukais revealed to be Satan as well as aHermaphroditewith angel wings. Nagai considering it appropriate due to being an angel, who are often considered sexless.Although not Satan himself, his second in command, the Demon LordZennon◊has a similar appearance to Satan inThe Divine Comedy, being a demon with 3 faces, first appearing in the manga frozen in a block of ice, while inDevilman Ladyhe happens to be contained in the Ninth Circle of Hell. InViolence Jack, Satan has him transform into a dragon for use in the final battle against Devilman, which could be seen as an allusion to The Beast of the Revelation.Father fromFullmetal Alchemistis the original homunculus, but he comes from the Gate of Truth, which is the franchise's equivalent of Heaven, and his backstory is much more in line with Lucifer, making him this.InMobile Fighter G Gundamthere's the Devil Gundam. At first it doesn't seem all that demonic, but as the series progressesand the machine is shown to have a will of its own, a vendetta against mankind, a tendency to corrupt everyone it comes in contact with, and at the grand finale is said to run off of negative emotions,it becomes a lot more obvious.The SpiderinHell Girlmay or may not be the devil. If not, then it's a simple case ofEverybody Hates Hades.InLets Bible, Iesu (pantsless girlJesus) is menaced by Evil Mexican Mariachi Satan.InMy Balls, Satan is a femalenymphomaniacandsex expertwho has both the power of light and darkness in her.She later hooks up withMichaeland becomes an angel again.O-Parts Hunter: Main character Jio has Satan sealed up inside him.Althoughnever making a direct appearance, Satan is a big part ofPhantom Thief Jeanne. It turns outthat Maron is actually working for Satan and not God when she collects the demons in paintings. She finds out too late to prevent Satan's overthrow of Heaven. Or so it seems...It seems that inPrincess Lucia, Satan lost his place in Hell and owns a ramen stand.Saint Seiya. Lucifer is theBig Badof fourth (non-canon) movie. In his backstory was considered in the kingdom of heaven to be the most beautiful and powerful sentient being after the Creator himself. Because of this, he developedprideandlustfor domination upon all of creation, and declared war on its Creator. He was subsequently defeated, and then banished from heaven along with his followers. He is defeated also by the archangel Gabriel, helped by Athena and the eastern god Marishitien. He feels a grudge against Athena and allies with other Gods for kill her and take over the world.In the \"Black Dragon King\" arc ofSpace Adventure Cobra, Evil is a giant and demonicFetus Terriblewho castshorrible illusionstofeed off the fear of peopleand turns his victims intosoulless abominations. After Cobra manages to barely overcome and kill Evil, he realizes the creature's race is what had long been described as Satan in legends.InThe Demon Ororon, Hell is a dimension ruled by kings who pass down the title of Satan from father to son. Which, if any, is THE Satan is unknown.That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime: He doesn't appear specifically, but his name and two best-known alias are tied to theSin SeriesUltimate Skills: Prideful King Lucifer, Wrathful King Satan, and Gluttonous King Beelzebub, all owned by theTrue Demon LordsGuy Crimson(the first Demon Lord and most powerful Primordial Demon who is a self-proclaimedEvil Overlord),Milim Nava(the second Demon Lord and daughter ofTrue Dragon Veldanava), andRimuru Tempest(the most recent Demon Lord whoeventually becomesa True Dragon himself). Rather fittingly, they are the three strongest True Demon Lords in existence.InUmineko: When They Cry, Satan is the third eldest sister of theStakes of Purgatoryand represents thesinofWrath. She is described as beingTsunderewithout the dere. Hell, all seven could count, since they're all named after the horned one. There's also Lucifer (Pride), Leviathan (Envy), Belpehegor (Sloth), Mammon (Greed), Beelzebub (Gluttony) and Asmodeus (Lust), in order of how old they are.\n\nArtsA freshly cast out of Heaven Lucifer (the one fromChristianity) is the subject ofAlexandre Cabanel's oil on canvas paintingThe Fallen Angel.The Sin: The snake is the Devil in disguise, the beast that introduced and tempted Eve into committing the original sin.The antagonist ofChristianityis notably lacking from theSistine Chapel's art, even when Hell is depicted alongside a host of demons inThe Last Judgement. Out of the hundreds of images in the Chapel, only two show man's greatest enemy:The first depiction is inThe Temptations of Christ, where Satan's evil is visualized with a hideous beard, bat-like wings, and a black cloak that hide his most inhuman figures, hoofed feet and furred body. His hairiness and hooves call to mind thepagan god Pan, subtly demonstrating Satan's role as a deceiver.The second depiction is on the Chapel's ceiling, which adapts the first parts of theBook of Genesis, where the is Devil depicted as a beautiful, scaled woman with a tail in the place of legs. It's unlike most other depictions of Satan, but it does have much in common with images ofLilith. In any case, the beauty of the woman acts as a reminder of the seductiveness of evil, while her scaled tail, which she hides from Adam and Eve, reveals that the Devil is hideous no matter how appealing he may seem.Witches' Sabbath (1798): He is portrayed as agarlanded goat, acting as aJesus-esquerole to a coven of witches. His appearance draws from theBaphometarchetype.\n\nComic BooksComic book example/subversion: Lucifer appears inThe Sandman (1989), initially as a one-off villain, but later in the series, he grows tired of ruling Hell and being humanity's scapegoat (\"How can anyoneowna soul?\") and resigns; Hell is then placed directly under \"The Silver City\"'s command.Sandmanformed the basis for his own seriesLucifera decade later, in which he's sort of but not quite anAnti-Hero. He appears as a blonde, handsome angel, with no hint of the demonic, except for bat wings — which heloses when he retires— and two tufts of hair intended to resemble horns. (He is referred to as \"Satan\" only once across both series, and that by a guy who wanted to make aDeal with the Devilandreallydidn't get it.)Hellblazer: Satan and Lucifer are two different entities (as it was originally written in demonology[1]). Hell is run, after the departure of Lucifer, by Satan (known here as the First Of The Fallen). It is suggested that The First is the original Adversary, that he was created to hold God's own negative qualities and/or as a \"best enemy\" to God (as in some East European dualist mythologies) and that he knows some horrible secret about God,Jesusand the Church which, if confessed to a mortal, would send that mortal howling mad. John Constantine claims that he is God's former conscience. The First looks human, big and tough, wearing a dinner suit and cape, with a broken nose and long hair. He is addressed as \"Lord Satan\" by Gabriel on one occasion. John met the First while the devil was trying to collect the soul of one of John's friends.It didn't go well for the First.The First of the Falleninitiallyshares his rule with the Second of the Three and the Third of the Three, who are similarly nasty. The Second appears as a living darkness, and the Third never appears as any one thing for long—he's a shapeshifter who constantly changes forms according to purpose, mood, or just for the fun of it, and it's implied he doesn't actuallyhavea true form. They don't appear as often, though.Partly because they're killed shortly after they're introduced.Several characters inThe DCUare a good match for Mr. S. There's Neron, who ruled Hell for a while and, as the main villain of theCrisis CrossoverUnderworld Unleashedbought the souls of many supervillains, as well as killingthe Roguesand Mongulto show how cool he is; Lord Satanus, who began as a human sorcerer yet grew powerful enough to kick Neron out; and his sister Blaze, who kickedhimout in return. The most likely candidate to be the real deal is The Original Darkness, anEldritch Abominationencountered bySwamp Thing, whose mere presence can kill several powerful sorcerers and whosefingernailcouldn't be cracked byThe Spectre. Finally, in the New 52 Lucifer appears as a villain inDemon Knights. InBatman RIPnumerous characters imply or outright state that Simon Hurt is the Devil. Batman himself wonders this at the end. It is ultimately revealed that heis not.There's a number of demons in theMarvel Universe, most famously Mephisto, who have at one point or another claimed to be Satan. InMystic Comics#4, origin of the originalGoldenAgeBlack Widow, Satan played an active roll in the plot,corruptingthe protagonistinto serving as his debt collector, butThe Twelveretconedthis into anEldritch Abominationposing as a demon, and all similar instances of Satan have been retroactive changed in similar manners with the statement Satan definitelyexistsbut has never appeared in a Marvel Comic book.Fear Itselfreveals that Satan — therealSatan, not the other demons who occasionally pretend to be him — has been missing for so long that many demons believe he never existed in the first place. The demons in the Marvel 'verse hold meetings around Satan's throne. None of them dare claim it for themselves, for fear of being torn apart by the others or worse,provoking Satan to return.The real Lucifer (different from Satan) shows up in oneGhost Riderstory claiming to be the one Johnny made a deal with and not Mephisto. He is one of several hell-lords, but unlike them cannot leave Hell on his own. He tricks Blaze into freeing him from hell to try and destroy the Earth, but quickly proves himself to beless than one hopedby being constantly outwitted by Blaze, who himself states that he is something of an idiot.The One Below All seems to be the ultimate evil in the Marvel Cosmos. Introduced inThe Immortal Hulk, his realm stretches under the entire multiverse and he uses a variant of the One Above All's description.The Devil appears briefly inPreacher, where he is in charge of Hell and follows the stereotypical red-skinned, horned and hooved depiction. He is seen playing cards with the Angel of Death and is called Nick. When the to-be Saint of Killers freezes Hell with his hate, Nick attempts to whip the hatred out but fails. After the to-be Saint accepts his new role, Nick insults the Saint and gets a fatal round through the head for the effort.Satan in the form of \"El Diablo\" pops up to show Johnny around Hell after his death inJohnny the Homicidal Maniac. Though he rules Hell, he doesn't seem to do much other than watch (with glee) the souls of the damned go about their superficial afterlives. He shows up again inSquee! (1997)as the happy husband of an oblivious Catholic woman with whom he's fathered a son, Pepito. Pepito becomes the closest thing Squee has to a friend.Another version of Satan shows up out of continuity in one of theMeanwhiles, where Jhonen, in an attempt to demonstrate how dissimilar his life is to Nny's after being accused ofAuthor Avatarone to many times, shows us what an average day is for him. In a scene that (deliberately) mirrors an earlyJTHMissue, he arrives at a convenience store to get a slushy and picks a fight with the clerk. He then goads the clerk into admitting to be Satan, turns out to be correct, and blasts Satan with a laser when Satan threatens to bite his head off.Jack Chick has put Satan into theChick Tractsso often you'd think he was a regular. Satan, when shown, ends up being more of a general trickster than a real force of pure evil.A demonic character shows up inPowersclaiming to be the devil, but the protagonist is more inclined to thinking it's a minor demon trying to make itself seem bigger and more important than it really is. It's still a powerful, nasty,Hannibal Lecturingcreature.InMagnus, Lucifer is a literalPhysical Godwho can be physically confronted and battled.Satan is notably absent from theHellboyuniverse, but he is finally mentioned inThe Wild Hunt. It turns out he's beensleeping beneath the city of Pandemonium and Hellboy is destined to murder him and overthrow all hisprinces and generals.2000 AD:A classicStrontium Dogstory involved Johnny, Wulf, and the Gronk following a renegadeBounty Hunternamed Fly's Eye's into aHell-dimension, where they had to beat up Satan himself in order to escape.It turns out that Satan is actually a human who invented a device to enable travel between dimensions, but was horribly burned and scarred when an experiment went out of control. Shunned and rejected by the rest of humanity, he retreated to an empty universe shaped by his own will, and out of bitterness, he made it into aFire and Brimstone Hellto torment anybody else who might wander in.InNecrophim, Lucifer takes the form of a human with a forked tongue dressed in Edwardian English fashion. He mostly just wants to keep hold of his reign in Hell.The Grievous Journey of Ichabod Azrael: Lucifer makes a brief appearance in the final arc when he visits the town of Atonement in the afterlife and freesthe Hunterto help him take it over.Anderson: Psi-Division: Judge Anderson once faced off with an nigh-omnipotent space-travelling entity which identified itself as Satan. After revealing its omnicidal harvests across the galaxy and its intent to destroy all life on Earth, it offered Anderson to join him as his herald. Satan was in fact borderline insane and lonely, and self-destructed when Anderson planted the seeds of doubt in him.Appears in some stories byWilhelm Busch, to take the (not so) pious Helene's soul to hell for example.Spawncomics introduced Satan only briefly. He is the brother ofGodand was the original creator/ruler of Hell before being removed by his \"Mother.\" God and Satan were two of a nearly infinite number of nigh-omnipotent beings created by the \"true\" God to help build worlds. They got Earth and, unwilling to share, fought over it, with God creating Heaven and Satan creating Hell, viewing humans as playthings in their wars. Out of disgust their Mother removed them from their thrones to try and give humanity a chance until Armageddon came. Both are evil, petty creatures. Ironically, Satan granted humans free will to spite God only for that to be what gives humanity the chance to free itself from both heaven and hell.In the 24-issue limited seriesCrimson, Lucifer appears as a dapper blond man, handsome and wearing all white. He converses with God in a very cordial way and the two appear to have more of a \"friendly rival\" relationship. However, there are also undertones of Lucifer still wanting The Throne.Black Moon Chronicles: Lucifer is a major character who rules over aFire and Brimstone Helland ultimately desires to have hisLegions of Helltake over the Earth to turn it into his second kingdom. This first requires his allyand half-demon sonHaazheel Thornto destroy the Empire of Lynn and causeGodto leave the world in disgust with his chosen few. The prequel album,A Cruel Game, also reveals that the whole events of the series are the result of aCosmic Chess Gamethat the Devil is playing with his chief lieutenant Pazuzu.Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi: \"Dark Agent\" shows the Devil as an entertainment manager who promises the girls wealth and fame beyond their wishes if they sign up with him, thus selling their souls to him. They reap the rewards of the deal but ennui soon sets in and they want their original manager Kaz back. Kaz challenges the Devil to a duel with Flying \"V\" guitars.\n\nComic StripsAngus Og: The Devil shows up in many incarnations throughout the run of the strip, but usually defaults to the classic goat-legged, horns, goatee, and pitchfork motif. He regularly tangled with protagonist Angus either attempting to snare his soul or with one of Angus' schemes causing havoc with one of his own, such as when Angus accidentally created giant demonic midges (a type of swarming biting black fly) which then got dumped in hell right on top of the Devil himself.Dilberthas a toned-down version of Satan, called the Prince of Insufficient Light. He carries a giant pitchspoon. When he curses you, he says\"I darn you to heck!\"\n\nFairy Tales & FolkloreThe Devil appears as the villain in a few stories fromThe Brothers Grimm, like \"The Grave Mound\", \"The Girl Without Hands\".

After eventually trapping her in the ice of the ninth circle as her final punishment, he lets his cool temperament drop, transforming into the monstrous Beast to angrily rant at her, before returning to his previous form.Manchester Lost: He is a menacing figure who mostly considers the archangels to be idiots (Raphael: too nice, Michael: too boneheaded, Uriel: completely out of it most of the time) with the possible exception of Gabriel. There is a great deal ofFoe Romance Subtextbetween him and Michael and inthe sequelhe and Gabriel work out a custody agreement for Michael. This is somewhat unnerving since he had recently killed Michael in a 3 way battle with Michael against Satan and the new Anti Christ.Pony POV Series: Morning Star, one of Celestia's siblings, is presented as a clearSatanic Archetypeas is. However, it's eventually revealed the pantheon have counterparts in the human world of Equestria Girls, Morning Star included, and Christianity also exists, implying Morning Star may in factbeSatan, or at least his human world counterpart inspired him.Sonic X: Dark Chaos: Lord Maledict is the titular Devil. Ruler of theDemon Empire, he's also the maker of the Chaos Emeralds, and helped create the entire universe.And he alsocreated Sonic the Hedgehog.

Disney hiredBela Lugosito come and be filmed as a model for this scene. They photographed him in his cape to capture his movements, flourishes, facial expressions and signature hand gestures to bring their Satan to life.The Point: This version appears as a \"man\" calledthe Pointed Man, with three different heads, much like Dante's depiction in the Inferno, one of whom is female. \"His\" purpose throughout the film is trying to convince Oblio that nothing has a point, citing \"a point in every direction is the same as no point at all.\"\n\nFilms — Live-ActionNaturally, Satan appears in severalBiblicalfilms aboutJesus.King of Kingsdepicted Satan as a disembodied voice during the temptation of Jesus in the desert. The 1979Jesusfilm did so as well.InThe Greatest Story Ever Told,Donald Pleasenceportrayed Satan as a \"Dark Hermit\" who tempts Jesus in a mountain cave.

Later when Jesus is crucified and the titularLast Temptationhappens, Satan appears as an angel in the form of a young girl and finally as the pillar of fire again.The 1999 television movieJesushad Satan played by Jeroen Krabbe in a modern suit and tie and a female model in red. The male Satan is more prominent, and he tries to dissuade Jesus by showing future events like the Crusades.Satan appears as an androgynous person (portrayed by a female actress) inThe Passion of the Christ. Notable for three scenes: the initial temptation of Jesus in the beginning of the film, a truly disturbing scene during Jesus's torture where Satan is seen cradling a demonic baby, in a mockery of the Virgin Mary, and a shot of Satan screaming in Hell, enraged at Jesus' sacrifice for humanity's sins and spiritual triumph.InLast Days In The Desert, set during Jesus's desert sojourn,Ewan McGregorplays bothJesus and Satan. The latter is dressed nigh-identically but wears jewellery.InThe Young Messiahhe's a blond, bearded man wearing a Black Cloak who torments Jesus at various points in the story, such as the beginning of the film when the bully is killed, and when Jesus is ill.InThe Ninth Gate,Johnny Depplooks for a book cowritten by Satan, is stalked by a (female) Satan who helps him on his quest, and then later has sex with her to gain immortal power.Two of a Kindfeatures a Sodom-and-Gomorrah plot, with God about todestroy the earthand bring all humanity into heaven unless a small band of angels can make two people fall in love with each other.

As her wagon rolls away we see her full name written on the back:Louise C. Faire.The \"Louis Cypher\" joke is done inAngel Heart (1987), in whichRobert De Niroplays the role. In one scene, he remarks that in many cultures, eggs are seen as a metaphor for the soul. He then promptly devours one.InO Brother, Where Art Thou?, the Devil appears as a whiteBounty Hunterwith a hound dog and sunglasses that are alwaysreflecting firelight. Before the start of the film, he gives Tommy Johnson the ability to play guitar \"real good\" in exchange for his soul. Throughout the movie, he hunts Ulysses and his group.InBedazzled (1967), the Devil is more in line with the Book of Job version, in which it's his/her job to test humanity with sin. Peter Cook plays the role as aDeadpan Snarkeranda Trickster, while Elizabeth Hurley plays a seductress inthe remake. Both seem to enjoy their job a lot.Lucifer is played with a chilling, vicious malevolence byViggo MortenseninThe Prophecy. Here he is an uneasy ally to the protagonists, but he makes it clear that he'shelping them for entirely self-serving reasons, not for their benefit. Mortenson actually manages to out-creepChristopher Walken.While they share a scene.Lucifer:[hissing to the main characters whilechewing on Gabriel's heart]I love you, I love you, I love you more than Jesus!Simon of the Desert: An ascetic has spent 6 1/2 years standing on a pillar in the middle of the desert praying to God. Satan appears in the form of a beautiful woman, with the express purpose of tempting him off of his perch.InConstantine (2005),Peter Stormareplays the Devil asa dapper middle-aged gent in a pristine white suit... save for his bare feet and pant cuffs, which are covered in steaming tar. His behavior is more in line with your average child molester than a suave prince of darkness or a roaring demon. In a rather fine example of outbargaining the devil for a favor,Constantine cuts his wrists and calls the Devil. After some idle chitchat, with the Devil helping John light up a cigarette, Constantine points the Devil to the fact his son and an angel are planning on releasing Satan's son onto earth. This irks the Devil as he feels Earth will be his in time and sends his son back to hell and, with God's blessing, turns the angel to human. The Devil returns to Constantine and offers him some more time as thanks. Instead of that, Constantine asks him to release the soul of the heroine's sister, who was damned for her suicide. The Devil does so easily. As the Devil is about to take him away, Constantine starts getting pulled up into heaven (and flips him off), and the Devil realizes that his \"suicide\" was really a self-sacrifice as he took no personal gain from the reward given. However, thinking quickly, he decides to use his powers to heal both Constantine's wrists and his cancer, using the logic that he's giving Constantine more time to damn himself again. Whether this works or not is left to the viewer.InJohn Carpenter'sPrince of DarknessSatan is revealed to be onlyThe Dragonto someone much, much worse...The Anti-God.InThe Devil and Max Devlin, the devil is played byBill Cosby.InThe Witches of Eastwick, the character Darryl Van Horne is implied several times to be the devil.

After two years of silence, being shuttled from one mental health facility to another, he reveals to his latest psychiatrist that he is actually Satan. She initially brushes this off as a common claim she hears in her line of work; besides, she doesn't believe in God or Satan. But during one of his first meetings with her he takes off her ring andmelts it in his hand, and not long afterward exerts psychic control over one of her other patients — the most innocent person in the asylum — and turns them into a serial killer as well, specifically targeting men of the cloth to boot. Mister Frost explains to her that humanity chalking evil up to mental illness/deviance rather than believing in himhas cost him the power he once held over them, and his master plan to reassert himself is to not only convince her that he is Satan, but to drive her to cross aGodzilla Thresholdandkill his human form, which would ruin her lifeand stop him from sowing further chaos.

We had a game, and yes, we made it up.\"InHunk,Dr. D.(James Coco), the president ofDevil Itself, Inc., is actually the Devil himself.InSix Gun Savior,Eric Robertsplays the Devil, who claims that the Bible has greatly exaggerated his powers, which is why he needs to recruit human agents to act for him on Earth.Dear Santahas Satan being accidently summoned by the human boy Liam via a letter meant forSanta Claushe misspelled.

Incidentally, Mephistopheles was originally just a demon serving under Lucifer/Satan; he became Satan in Goethe's version.InJohannes Cabal the NecromancerSatan is presented more or less as the Biblical version-though he's a point in his immortal life where he's become jaded, bored and slightly snarky. He makes a wager with the titular character just to be entertained and doesn't much care to win or lose-but he does still have a bit of a temper.InJohannes Cabal and the Fear Institute, the third book in the series, it is implied though not totally confirmed that Satan may be an aspect ofNyarlathotep.The classic storyThe Devil and Daniel Websterhas been dramatized for television and film countless times. Satan is oftenAffably Evilin these depictions, and takes the (actually rather hard to argue with) position that he's not doing anything evil by trying to claim the New Hampshire farmer's soul, since he held up his end of the deal and all he's asking is that the other man do the same.Subverted in theArthur C. ClarkenovelChildhood's End, where the devil-like aliensreally are the Good Guys, there to help the human race toreach the next stage of evolution, the twist is that the process is so traumatic that it resonates back through time, causing them tobecome a diabolical archetype in the human collective unconscious.Robert A. Heinlein:Subverted in his novelJob: A Comedy of Justice, where Satan is one of the nicer characters.InMagic, Inc., the heroes reach Hell and its king, whom custom demands that he let them reviewThe Legions of Hellto find their enemy.Played with in the Russian classicThe Master and Margarita.Woland causes mass mayhem in 1930s Moscow including but not limited to driving hack writers insane, beheading someone (he got better) and sending thousands of Muscovites into the streets naked. Yet despite his deviousness, the novel shows a Soviet Russia so screwed up that Woland and his entourage come across asManipulative Bastardsat worst. By the end of the novel, Woland's even in league withJesusto grant a young couple peace (essentially send them to Dante's first level of heaven). Woland isn't seen perpetrating evil at all. He and his ilk are shown handing punishments right and leftto those who deserve them, which just happen to be everyone. While Woland doesn't agree with Yeshua on some key philosophical points, he's actually shown asa force of good(with a twisted sense of humor).The Dark One (whose real name is Shai'tan) in Robert Jordan'sThe Wheel of Timeseries, who is seen as somewhat less powerful than The Creator, but also vastly, infinitely more powerful than any being in the material world. This series also gets bonuses in that many of The Dark One's top ranked minions have names based synonyms for Devil (Asmodean, Bel'al, Ba'alzamon, et al), and several pseudonyms for The Dark One are obviously based on real world names meaning the same thing.The Devil's Storybook(and sequel) has ten short stories about the Devil trying to do things. He wins roughly half the time; a few stories push him to the background to dwell on the affairs of Hell or such. Examples:The Devil encounters a perfect girl, one who never pouts or has a temper or does anything wrong at all. He throws everything he's got at her, trying to make her imperfect, but it never works. Until finally he hits on a plan that has her losing her temper a dozen times a day:He gives her a perfect husband and a perfect home, then sends her an average child.A demon brings a rose to Hell, and plants it; when it blossoms, its aroma fills Hell, disgusting the Devil, who investigates.

When the man has almost completed his task, the housekeeper dies and ends up in Hell...An incarnation of the devil appears to Ivan inThe Brothers Karamazov(in the form of animpoverished country gentleman) and carries on a long conversation with him about the cruelties of the world. Because the narrator warns us that Ivan is suffering fromBrain Fever, we're left uncertain as to whether the conversation is real or a demented hallucination. Ivan tries to prove that he's a hallucination several times, only to have the devil trump him by proving thathe could very well be real.In theBetsy The Vampire Queenbooks, Betsy's half-sister is Satan's daughter. In this case, Satan is her mother. \"She's\" only made one non-flashback appearance, in which she scolds her daughter for \"rebelling\" (In this case, consciously being the biggestPollyannapossible).InInfernosection ofThe Divine Comedy, Satan is a gigantic, monstrous idiot at the lowest point of hell, which is also the center of the earth. He's trapped waist-deep in ice, which is kept forever frozen by the wind of his flapping wings as he tries to escape. This factors into the common Christian theme of sinners placingthemselvesin hell, rather than God or Satan sending them there. Arch-sinners Cassius, Brutus and Judas are forever getting chewed up in Satan's mouth.Inferno (Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle)andEscape From Hell, based on Dante's work, have a somewhat more articulate Satan who talks to the protagonistswhen they are climbing down him to escape, suggesting sardonically that God \"could take lessons in morality from Vlad the Impaler\" and that \"He could have made a better universe by throwing dice\".InFor Love of Evil, a priest named Parry becomes Satan after his corruption by the forces of Hell goes a bit too well. However, he's something of aPunch-Clock Villain, choosing tomanageEvil rather thanembodyit. This is just fine with the other Incarnations, and we eventually find out why.Hungarian playwright Imre Madách'sThe Tragedy Of Manfeatures Lucifer as a guide of Adam in his dream through ages fromAncient EgypttoThe Future. He appears as a benevolent character, but his ultimate goal was to corrupt humanity and drive Adam to suicide because of a wager with God (a very unique case ofDeal with the Devilindeed). He fails.Satan is (naturally enough) the central character of Jeremy Leven's novelSatan: His Psychotherapy and Cure by the Unfortunate Dr. Kassler, JSPS* (*Just Some Poor Schmuck), in which he undergoes seven sessions of therapy that leave him increasingly better off, but which don't quite work out so well for the poor Dr. K.In a similar vein, inClark Ashton Smith's short storySchizoid Creator, a psychiatrist tries to cure Satan, under the belief that Satan and God are just two sides of a split personality. This theory turns out to betrue.InOperation Chaos, byPoul Anderson, the hero is not certain whether he's actually met Satan or merely one of his higher-ups (or lower-downs as the case may be). He's certainly met an extremely powerful devil.Good Omenshas Satan, but he never actually appears, leaving the work to various underlings, including Beelzebub.Lucifer stars as a major character in Lilith Saintcrow'sDante Valentineseries. He is an androgyne, meaning a demon who can reproduce.C. S. Lewis:InPerelandra, Satan appears as the main villain, possessing the body of the previous book's villain. Lewis goes out of his way to deconstruct the popular image of the Devil—while heistruly brilliant and can be incredibly charming when he wants to, he seems to derive his deepest pleasures from acting like an annoying five-year-old or torturing small animals to the brink of death without actually showing the mercy of killing them. In short, he'sThe Dark Knight's Joker,only without the entertaining sense of humor.InThe Screwtape Letters, Satan is called \"Our Father Below\" by Screwtape, a mirror of \"Our Father, in Heaven\".Mark Twain's bookLetters From The Earthis told from Satan's point of view. Despite being loyal to God, he gets banished to Earth for a day in angel time for speaking unwisely. However, because ofTime Dissonancethis means he is stuck there for what seems to us a long time during which he sends back letters on humanity, their nature, and Christianity. In the bookhe comes off as not at all evilthough possessing a refined sense of irony and a slight bafflement at humanity.The Sorrows of Satan(1895), byMarie Corelli, centers on the premise that Satan actually wants people to resist his temptations, because every human being who rejects him moves him that much closer to being allowed back into Heaven.I, Luciferby Glen Duncan has Lucifer being granted a second chance for redemption by living life as a mortal. The book is told from his perspective with all the dark humour, sex and charm you'd expect from the devil himself. Deals with his side of the story.The Vampire Chronicles:Anne Ricetoys with the concept of Satan several times:In \"The Tale of the Body Thief\", one character imagines Satan not as a single entity but instead as a specific duty assigned to various entities throughout history, the job presumably entailing tempting and testing humankind ala Job.In \"Memnoch the Devil\", vampire anti-hero Lestat actually meets the title character (apparently \"Memnoch\" is his original name and he dislikes being called \"Satan\" or anything else) and learns that while he is indeed a rebellious angel thrown from heaven, he's not at all evil (although he'snot really exactly good either) and is involved in some sort of cosmic wager with God on whether or not wicked souls can be rehabilitated.InThe Guardians, the throne of Hell is currently held by Lucifer Morningstar, but Beliel is waging anEnemy Civil Warto take it from him.Satan makes an appearance at the end ofThe Monkto claim Ambrosio's soul personally.InThe Descent, after a vast underground realm populated by demon-like hominids has been discovered, a group of scholars infer bya priorireasoning (ie. guessing) that if this has been the inspiration for hell and demons, the figure of Satan in mythology must also be based on a real person who has been reincarnating over the ages.They're right, and he's one among their own number.InThe Dresden Fileshe doesn't physically appear but does exist. He seeks to unleash the Apocalypse onto the world but cannot physically get involved with the mortal plane without drawing Heaven's attention, which will act to counter his influence with equal force. So he cursed theThirty Pieces of Silverpaid to Judas to allow thirty of his followers a chance into the mortal world. These Fallen can inhabit a mortal and give them access to dark but awesome magic and power (SeeDemonic Possessionfor more about them). He gave his menaccess to Super-hellfire in order to bind aPhysical God. Andhe is on the short list of Fallen wholiedto Harry Dresden, who spoke a dark untruth for the purpose of destroying Harry and succeeded in making Harry kill himself.InPlease Don't Tell My Parents I'm a Supervillain, Lucyfar claims to be the Archangel Lucifer, Princess of Lies. Initially, this seems like an obvious lie, especially since her only power appears to be summoning floating black knives—which is cool and all, but not exactly on Lucifer's level.When she gets annoyed, however, she conjures an elegant black dress, skeletal wings, and a crown of black fire, all while completelyno-sellingsome pretty hard-core magic. Lends a bit of weight to her claim.Ro.Te.O: Lucifer isn't actually Satan...that's Terrafer's job. The usual tropes of Satan are split pretty evenly between the two though. As for powers, fellow devil Kira getslight, Lucifer gets the firepower (in more ways than one) andTerrafer's is a given.Dora Wilk Seriessimilarily splits the position between two fallen. Lucifer has the name, the psychic and magical might and the rulership over Hell, while Sammael (another name of Satan) is in charge of department of punishments and is extremely hostile towards Dora while Luc is aCool Old Guyto his grandson's girlfriend.He's in charge of hell inThe Grim Reaper's Apprentice. He's a fairly nice guy, and apparently there is a story behind how he ended up in charge of hell, though he decides to postpone said story to a later date when Jax asks.The Shadowhunter Chronicles: Lucifer is mentioned to be the first of the demons, a Prince of Hell, and a fallen angel.He has yet to appear, but is said to be a powerful being. He is also unpredictable and rarely grants favors for anyone. According toThe Eldest Curses, he has been MIA for a while, something that the other Princes of Hell are rather anxious about. An interesting tidbit is that Lucifer and Sammael (a name used to refer to Lucifer in the Kabbalah) are separate beings; Sammael is one of Lucifer's top lieutenants, the Serpent who caused the fall of man, led the Incursion alongside Lilith, and is the archenemy of theArchangel Michael.Appears midway through theLeft Behindseries, challenging God and attacking Him with his army of angels before he and they were cast down to Earth in time to resurrect Nicolae Carpathia so he could fulfill his role asThe Antichrist. He appears again near the end of the Tribulation as he briefly departs from Carpathia to remind him of his place as a servant, then later is cast out by Jesus Himself and forced to stand trial for his crimes against humanity before he is sent into the bottomless pit for a thousand years, only to be released in time to lead The Other Light's coup against the people of God, which fails spectacularly when God incinerates the whole army in seconds before Satan joins the Antichrist and the False Prophet in the Lake of Fire.Satan, under the name Apollyon, is theGreater-Scope VillainofWars of the Realm. He is the ultimate commander of all demonic forces in the universe. However, he is given fairly little screen time, with most of the action being focused on the conflicts between the angel and demon armies on the frontline level. Drew Carter, the human deuteragonist, only gets to see him once.Into the Fiery Abyss: He appears toJermaine, introduces himself to them, and welcomes them toHellwhen they'reDragged Off to Hell.\n\nLive-Action TVInAmerican Gothic (1995), Sheriff Lucas Buck apparently is or is possessed by the Devil.Ashes to Ashes (2008): In theGrand Finale, one of the characters is tentatively revealed as the devil:DCI Keats. Creators involved have beeninconsistent, andKeats is never explicitly identified as Satan except by Matthew Graham in one interview.

The First's right hand man Caleb refers to Satan as a \"little man\".Satan, or, at least, someone resembling him, later appears inAngel— \"Izzerial the Devil\", a tennis partner of Angel and a member of the season'sBig Badgroup \"The Circle of the Black Thorn\", although he is killed by aEldritch Abominationin human form.The comics followingAfter the Fallfeature another devil who is constantly being mistaken for a demon. He's also blue, but has a human form.TheAngelepisode \"The Cautionary Tale of Numero Cinco\" mentions an incident where \"the devil built a robot.\"noteEl Diablo Robótico, which is also the name of a band.However , while many satanic looking figures appear, the notion ofTheDevil seems to be averted in the Buffyverse, notable in that there is no one, singular Hell, rather a series of dimensions, each with it's own Satanic archetype, such as the Hellgod Glorificus, it seems to be a universe ofAngels, Devils and Squidwith no single God or Devil, with leanings towards moreDemon Lords and Archdevilsand anyBig Goodis usually portrayed as more grey than white.InChilling Adventures of Sabrina, Satan is worshipped as the true god by the witches of the Church of Night, who try to present him as a champion of free will who is the victim of Christian propaganda. However, he clearly expects full obedience from his worshippers or else they suffer. He also able to manifest on Earth at will, either through possessing people or taking on a physical form similar toBaphomet.Until the end of Season 1, when Sabrina is tricked into fulfilling a prophecy that allows Satan to fully emerge on Earth in his original angelic form (minus the wings God tore off during the Fall). Satan also reveals at this point thathe's Sabrina's real fatherand intends for her to rule Earth by his side. Instead he ends upsealed inside Nick Scratchand taken by to Hell byLilith.The Collector: The Devil is a central character; He isomniscient, his relationship with God(who is not heard from) is adversarial but otherwise unclear, and heclaimsthat he only seeks to dogood. Each episode has himplayed by a new actor, actress, or in one memorable casepuppet, and his main activity as seen through the series is making standardizeddealswith mortals.Doctor Whohas several monsters identified as the basis for Satan:The Dæmons(of the planet Dæmos) are identified in the eponymous serial as a race ofadvanced alienswho formed the basis of human demonic mythology. The whole thing is a slightly shamelessrip-offof the earlier serial and movieQuatermass and the Pit(Five Million Years to Earthin the US).Sutekhin \"Pyramids of Mars\" is explicitly noted by the Fourth Doctor to be the real Satan.Tom Bakeralso conceptualised another Whoniverse Satan, Scratchman (Played byVincent Price), for his Doctor to battle in a film, butnothing came of it.However, Baker later turned the screenplay into a book,Doctor Who Meets Scratchman.\"The Impossible Planet\"/\"The Satan Pit\" would reveal the \"real\" Satan,the Beast, a big scary monster bound since before the dawn of time by an ancient race and the origin of every mythology's Devil. What makes it considerably more worrying is that it has enough telekinetic power to resist the pull of a black hole for billions upon billions of years, and it's a cruelManipulative Bastardwith a mind that even the Doctor admits is brilliant, one fully capable of reading minds and pullingDemonic Possession(and hiding that fact frighteningly well), very nearly pulling off a successful and nigh impossible escape byhiding most or all of its mind in Toby, its host - how much the Beast retains is unclear, but it laughs when the Doctor realises that something is up. Of course, the Doctor's skeptical, since he's met so many \"real\" versions of mythological beings, though as he acknowledges, the stories have to startsomewhereand this particular entity is a much better candidate for that than most. The Dæmons are mentioned in passing as aContinuity Nod.TheTorchwoodfirst season finale goes on to feature Abaddon, the son of the aforementioned Beast.Dominion (2014): Lucifer's existence is confirmed in the first season finale, when Michael and Gabriel discuss how \"The Son of Morning\" was born alone, unlike the other Archangels, who were born in pairs.Near the end of the second season, his presence in the setting is confirmed, as Michael realizes that he's the mysterious force keeping the angels out of Mallory. Why he's doing this is unknown, but Michael doubts his apparent benevolence.In the miniseriesFallen, Lucifer, the last fallen angel still on Earth, asks our hero to redeem him and send him back to Heaven.

This Satan is portrayed as aBig Red Devilwith seven horns and the voice ofBenedict Cumberbatch. Adam calls Satan out on being aDisappeared Dadwho never showed any interest in him until now.Henshin Ninja Arashihas theGreat Demon KingSatan. He looks like your standard angelic depiction of Lucifer, and he has aFlying Saucerthat he rides around in.InJoan of Arcadia, Satan appears to Joan as sinister versions of previous God incarnations.Or it could've been hallucinations based on Joan's bout with Lyme Disease.It could be that this was simply God testing her, like Job. The second (and final) season finale, however, introduces Ryan Hunter, a person who it's implied previously talked to God and may now be talking to the Devil (or is the Devil). We'll never know though.TheBonus RoundofThe Joker's Wildhad a devil (allegedly modeled after series creator and hostJack Barry) that popped up — here he functioned as aWhammyduring the round — if he showed up, you lost all the cash you had accumulated in the round. (This was Barry & Enright's firstLuck-Based Missionstyle bonus round; their other shows had different \"villains\" —a dragon,a bolt of lightning,a stop sign...)Lucifer in, well,Lucifer (2016)presents himself as the victim of bad press. Since it's loosely based onthe comic series, he's actually somewhere between anAnti-Heroand aReasonable Authority Figurewho happens to have areally nasty job. Also, he's considerably nicer than most of the peopleopposinghim.Married... with Children: Al Bundy sold his soul to Lou(cifer) for NFL glory.

He offers Shelley a more glamorous life if she will only burn her husband's favorite sweater, but she refuses.Penny DreadfulhasVanessa Ivesplagued by a \"demon\" that eventually identifies itself as Satan, and always appears in the form of a human she knows, usually doing an excellent job of pretending to be that human and having a decent conversation with her until it decides it's time to bring out theBlack Eyes of Evil.Season 2 gives us a major reveal about this version;when Lucifer rebelled, God split him in half, and sent one half to Earth to feed on blood (the as-yet-unnamed Dracula), and the other down to Hell to feed on the souls of the damned (Satan), and Satan needs Vanessa, the \"mother of evil\", to submit to him to bring about the apocalypse.Season 3 then gives us the even more shocking reveal thatSatan is theweakerof the two brothers;as a spiritual being that requires people to believe in him to maintain his strength, he is at a disadvantage in the age of science and enlightenment, while the terrestrial Dracula only needs blood and so has grown stronger and more dangerous over the centuries.Satan is the main character's unseen father inPoint Pleasant.Quantum Leap: In the memorableHalloween Episode, the Devil impersonates Al in an attempt to trap and punish Sam for the\"fixes\" and improvementshe'd made in the timeline (unless it wasAll Just a Dream).

As Mulder puts it \"Did you think you could just summon the Devil and then ask him to behave?\"Perhaps the best candidate (though there's no reason they can't all be him) is Aaron Starkey in \"All Souls\".

Identified as the most cunning of the animals, the Serpent speaks to the first Woman and convinces her to ignore God's warning of death and take the fruit of the Tree of Good and Evil by claiming the fruit will make her and her husband equal to God, even though all it does is doom them to do evil and die. Because of his evil, God curses the Serpent by pitting humanity against him, telling of how the offspring of the woman will crush the Serpent's head.TheBook of Jobintroduces its exploration of the problem of evil, the idea that an infinitely good God could not exist if there is evil, by painting a scene where the satan, or \"the accuser\" in English, goes to God's court and wagers that God's most righteous follower, Job, can be turned away from Him if he was faced with evil and suffering. With God's allowance, Satan strips Job of his property, his wealth, his family, and his health, and goes unmentioned as Job questions why God would allow such a thing.AsJesusfasted in the desert for forty days,The Four Gospelsattest that the Devil tempted him byquoting Scriptureto try and get him to break his fast, test God by jumping from the top of a temple, and bow to Satan in exchange for rule over the kingdoms of the world. Christ has a Scriptural response to deny Satan at every turn and leaves the desert completely unfazed by everything the Prince of Lies threw at him.TheBook of Revelationgives us the image of a great red dragon with seven heads, one who leads one-third of the angels in Heaven against God and hisArchangel Michael, only to be thrown out of the Heavens, as the narration reveals that the Dragon would come to be known as the Serpent of Genesis, the Devil, and Satan. However, this time Satan goes to thelake of firefor hisimmenseevil.The Qur'anmentions Shaitan as another name for Iblis, itself likely derived from the Greek word for Satan, Diabolos. Depending on interpretation, Iblis is either an angel or ajinnwho refused to kneel before Adam. (And by extension humanity) As a result, he was cast out of Heaven and became the first infidel (kafir). Unlike the Bible, Iblis is explicitly described as being responsible for goading Adam's wife to eat the forbidden fruit, as he had vowed to tempt humanity following his expulsion.Some religionsare based around him. As a general rule though, they don't sacrifice goats or anything. In fact, many don't even worship him specifically. La Veyan Satanists don't even strictly believe in Satan, but rather hold him up as a symbol of humanityadhering to our nature. The idea being that one shoulddo whatever makes them happy, both altruistically and not. As a general rule, most flavors of Satanism are atheists who don't believe in the supernatural. They are more anti-religions that focus on \"worshipping\" one's self or humanity rather than the actual devil.\n\nPro WrestlingA competitor in Lucha Libre Internacional during the 1970s, best known for teaming with Ciclón Mexicano.

This is shown to be an extremely arduous task, because almost all human beings have committed a sin of some kind. On one occasion, God accepts that Satan's punishment was out of proportion to his crime, but refuses to pardon him, as the existence of Satan is necessary for reasons that God will not reveal. In the fifth series, the Devil subverts his usual role by trying to convince Humanity to act in a moral manner, in order to ease the congestion in Hell.\n\nTabletop GamesInArs Magica, the influence of (the Christian)Godand Satan is pervasive inMythic Europe.

After awakening, he conquers and destroys humanity's interstellar empire until a mysterious alien Titan leads the remnants of free humanity in destroying his physical form, but civilization is left in ruins. The remnants of Lucifer's empire fight each other for control of the martian surface, while the Titan's followers (as well as those who just don't want to be ruled by the Luciferan Church) live mostly in orbit in the dead Titan's hollowed out skull and other scattered colonies.Third party supplements for Fifth Edition,Inferno: Dante's Guide to HellandInferno: Virgilio's Untold Taleshave Lucifer trapped at the bottom of Hell, even with a statblock, so he can be fought. He has exactly 666 hit points.Yet another third party book,Azazel's Guide to the Apocalypsehas not one but two statblocks for Satan - The Dragon and Avatar of Satan, so now you can fight him twice.The French gameIn Nomine Satanis / Magna Veritashas you playing either demons (INS) or angels (MV). It is a subversion of Christianity in that devils are not all bad, and angels...well, there is an Archangel of the Inquisition, and you would not want to meet the Archangel of the Sword, either. Kinda short on the tolerance and all-inclusive love, these guys are. Anyway, Satan is either your Big Bad, or the boss of your boss. A campaign revolves around him getting depressed and wanting to quit his job.The American adaptation bySteve Jackson Games,In Nomine,maintains much the same feel, but its version of Satan is as remote and unknowable as God. In his very few appearances, it's made clear that he's not funny, friendly, charming, suave, honorable, or quirky. His defining traits are that he's very powerful, very smart, andhates you,along with everyone else in Creation.Lucifer was a prominent figure in theOld World of Darkness. InDemon: The Fallen, he led one third of the Heavenly Host to rebel againstGod, believing this to be the only way to prevent a vague impending cataclysm, which his friend Ahrimal had foreseen and which God refused to do anything about.It turned out, said cataclysm WAS Lucifer's rebellion in the first place.Interestingly, Lucifer is not theBig Badin the game: in fact, he is probably the staunchestbeliever in humanitythe World of Darkness has ever seen. His former lieutenants, however, areEldritch Abominations...In modern times, however he's, by all accounts, missing in action...as is God, leaving the newly-escaped Fallen to wonder what to do next.Rather shockingly, thePalladium Fantasy Role Playing Gameallows players to create Witch characters who receive their powers from Satan. Take that, moral guardians!Retconned in later editions. Witches now get their powers fromalien intelligences.InKULT, his name is Astaroth (but he has 666 avatars walking around using different names).In first and second editionNobilis, Lucifer is the Imperator of Pride and Persuasion. Once, he was the greatest leader among the angels, but following the creation of humanity, he formed a particular loathing for humans (no one knows why, save maybe Lucifer himself) and rebelled against Heaven, rejecting the angelic belief in Beauty as the highest principle and championing Corruption in its place. He and the angels who followed him were cast into Hell, a place of corruption incarnate — yet despite that, he apparently remains true to his beliefs, untouched by Hell's corruption. This was changed for the third edition: the fallen angels now fell because they felt everything deserved love, even the monstrous and wicked, as opposed to the angels, whose belief in justice meant they felt the wicked had no place in things. Lucifer is mentioned in passing, still first of the fallen and Imperator of Pride and Persuasion, but what he's like is unknown.The Adversary inShadowrunis an Idol/Mentor Spirit for Shamans to follow. Despite its dark connotations (the Adversary is outright said to equal Satan in the Judeo-Christian tradition) the Adversary isn't toxic and is about as \"evil\" as any of the other mentor spirits—it is a legitimate mentor for Shadowrunning anarchists. Following The Adversary means you're physically incapable ofJust Following Orders, and don't think he'll let you off easily if you spurn the shadows in order to work forThe Man.Yu-Gi-Oh!: Infernoid Shaitan is based on Satan. In fact, its effects could be a reflection of Satan's actions in the Book of Job. In the Book of Job, Satan challenged God that Job (a pious man with a righteous life) would turn from God if he were allowed to plague the man undeterred by God's protection. Job had his possessions and wealth stripped from him and his family killed by plague, but stayed faithful. In a similar fashion, Infernoid Shaitan strips the opponent of their \"niceties\" by throwing their Set cards back to the deck– disregarding the \"protection\" of their other effects.\n\nTheatreOne of the main characters inDamn Yankeesis Mr. Applegate, the Devil, whostrikes a bargainwith baseball fan Joe Hardy to let him play for his team and win the pennant.Lucifer is the main character ofThe History of the Devil, where he issympathetic but still not a nice guy. He is put on trial for causing human suffering; the main theme of the play is whether the devil really is responsible for human suffering orwe brought it on ourselves.\n\nVideo GamesAfterpartyrevolves around two teens who end up in Hell and try to escape by beating Satan in a celestial drinking tournament. The game heavily parodies and deconstructs the wholeMan of Wealth and Tasteportrayal; here, Satan comes off like apathetic,drunkenFratbro.Whereas the otherAlone in the Darkgames focused on Lovecraftian horror, the2008 rebootinstead has Lucifer as theGreater-Scope Villain.He's the light bringer. He's thefuckinguniverse.ANTONBLAST: TheBig Badof the game is Satan himself, depicted as aBig Red Devilwho is jealous of Anton for being redder than him, and so schemes to siphon his redness to become the reddest person in the world.Bayonetta:Queen Sheba is the ruler of Inferno, the realm of demons that Bayonetta often taps into for her most stylish finishers. In fact,Bayonetta summons Sheba herself in order to finish off the Creator God Jubileus bypunching her all the way throught the solar system and into the sun.Rodin himself also counts all of the character art for Rodin in the unlockable extras never uses that name, giving his name as \"Mephisto\", the name of a German folklore demon most prominently mentioned in the Faust legend and occasionally has been used as another name for the Devil himself. Appropriately, Rodin's role is broadly similar to the traditional devil: a fallen angel who is thwarted and punished from trying to conquer Heaven (and is feared by it) who rules his own \"sub-basement\" location after his punishment, and jokes about the \"deals\" he provides Bayonetta.The Binding of Isaacfeatures him as one of the final bosses (in the vanilla version, anyway). He also has anabsolutely badass theme song.Rebirthincludes the optional encounter ofMEGA SATAN, theTrue Final Boss.His theme song has also gottenan even more badass upgrade.Broforce: Since the whole game is an exaggerated parody of action movies andearly 2000s American foreign policy, Satan is theBig Badbehind all the Terrorists and Illegal Aliens in the game, and their bases sportSatanic iconography everywhere. Obviously he is theFinal Bosswho shows up in the flesh after bringing Hell itself to America, is insanely ripped with aCarpet of Virilityandhas aOne-Winged Angelform accompanied by anelectric guitar theme.InCastlevania: Lords of Shadow, Satan inThe Man Behind the Man, responsible for a long list of atrocities humankind has been witness to.First, he manipulated the heroic Founders of the Brotherhood of Light into performing anAngelic Transformationritual that separated them from their evil sides. Satan brainwashed and possessed one of the titular Lords of Shadow, and under that guise, accompanied the protagonist, Gabriel Belmont, waiting while the latter assembled an artifact that would allow him to re-enter Heaven and take revenge upon God. Gabriel thwarted Satan's plan, and with God's help, banished him back to Hell.Satan returns inCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2, this time around, however, with a different motive: he wishes to enslave both Gabriel and Zobek following his humiliating defeat. This prompts the two mortal enemies to join forces and use their combined powers to locate and eliminate Satan's Acolytes on Earth.Ultimately — intentionally — Gabriel fails, and the last surviving Acolyte summons his father. But despite all of his prowess and cunning, Satan is defeated once more, and Gabriel pierces his heart with the Vampire Killer, putting an end to the original Prince of Darkness.The Devil is the main villain ofCuphead, to whom the protagonists end up owing their souls after an unlucky roll of the dice at his casino. He forces them to go out and collect the soul contracts of others in order to pay off their debt.Obligatorily theBig BadofDante's Inferno. From some of his rants, it seems that he was locked up because he refused to bow down to humans, who were created in God's image, rather than because he tried to overthrow God (though that does seem to be his goal by the time the events of the game roll around).This is actually the reason for the fall of Iblis, Islam's version of the Devil.Death Smilesdecided that plain old Satan was too boring, so its final boss and head of the demonic invasion triggered by Jitterbug isDemonic Imperator Tyrannosatan.And the sequel has as its final boss a bizarre mash-up of demon andSanta Clauscalled...\"Satan Claws\".Youwork forSatan in the firstDeception, plotting to resurrect him. At least, at first; whether youcontinueworking for him through the story is up to you. In the fifth game,Deception IV: Blood Ties, you play as his daughter with the same goal of bringing him back.Desperate Love Feasthas him briefly appear in one scene where he calls the protagonist \"cute\" and promises to watch over him. It is also heavily indicated thathe is theGreater-Scope Villainwho droveBig BadChihiro insane.Mundus fromDevil May Cry, who was originally intended to be named Satan. He comes in white and looks somewhat like an angel (that is, until Dante messes him up but good, revealing theEldritch Abominationwithin). He's not quite omnipotent, though, but it does seem thus far that he cannot be permanently killed, even with the power of Sparda, so Dante eventually has to seal him away like his father did long ago.In theDiablovideo game series, the protagonists must fight the three Prime Evils: Diablo, Mephisto, and Baal. All are alternate names for Satan.InDiablo IIIDiablo \"becomes\" Satan with the Black Soulstone, which combines the Soul of the Seven Evils into Tathamet, the personification of all evil in the Diablo universe.The Outsider from theDishonoredseries is not a proactive force of destruction, but much closer to the original Hebrew definition of Satan as the accuser/tempter from the Book of Job, as instead of being a prince of darkness, he grants pieces of his power to a select few individuals at any time and watches what they do with it. A strong argument can be made either way that this is meant mainly as a test of his chosen's moral character (and one he prefers his subjects pass, even if he doesn't expect them to), or that the Outsider knows damn well how quickly power goes to their heads and relies on their fallibility to sow chaos and misery in the world without getting his hands dirty. Regardless of his actual nature, the local church in the game treats him as essentially anExpyof Old Scratch.For a series about going to Hell to kill demons with face-fulls of hot lead and plasma,DOOMhas been quite coy about depicting Old Scratch himself, likely to avoid pissing off theMoral Guardianseven more than the game's premise will. It took five games and a DLC to reveal Satan in the flesh; previously, expies include the Icon of Sin inDoom II: Hell on Earthnotea giant goat-skull embedded in a wall that births demons to fight you. He becomes a full-fledged kaiju final boss inDoom Eternal, the Maledict fromDoom³notea massive Hell-Dragon, alluding to one of Satan's described forms from Revelation, and the Titan fromDoom (2016)notea skyscraper sized demon that Doomguy already killed in the game's backstory.Doom Eternal's first DLC reveals the backstory behind the Doom universe's version of Satan: Davothnotehe's the narrator of the Slayer's Testaments for some weird reasonwasthe first experimental creation of the multiverseand given domain over paradise, but God could only give immortality to a few of his creations, so Davoth had to watch the mortals he loved and watched over die constantly. Davoth became obsessed with discovering the secret to mass-producing immortality, creating experimental monsters, driving himself mad, and turning paradise into literal Hell, until he waged war with The Father and lost. Since then,his essence has been sealed in an orb of divine power, but his ghost is so powerful that he still commands the armies of Hell. Even afterdecillionyears, he is still obsessed with achieving true mass-produced immortality and getting revenge on all of his enemies in the process, even if it causes the slow and painful extermination of all other life in the multiverse, which has driven the plot of the entire series.Also, his physical form is physically identical to the Doom Slayer's, he intentionally orchestrated the Doom Slayer's journey so that Doomguy would kill all his enemies for him,and technically, he is God.Maybe.Evertalehas Lucifer and Satan portrayed as two unreleated characters from separate worlds. Lucifer is a fairy who was sealed away at the heart of the island of Avalon to ensure nobody can abuse her immense powers, but she was kept there for so long that she grew resentful and agreed to helpKing Arthurto destroy the world. Satan, on the other hand, is the leader of the demonkin race who brags about taking over the world when she reallyjust wants a home for her peoplewho had been enslaved byArcanefor 2,000 years.FAITH: The Unholy Trinityis spent hunting down demons and their worshippers as they attempt to summon the Antichrist upon the mortal plane, and yet Satan himself only makes one appearance throughout the entire trilogy, and it's asa being of pure lightin a flashback. He offers John a chance to leave the home of a possessed girl, but only if he swears to forfeit her soul. In his weakness, John relents. This sends him down a path of regret that ultimately leads to him returning a year later to make things right, which is the start of the game.Manages to be subverted inFate/hollow ataraxia: the guy who is claimed to be the Devil was actually just some villager who was completely powerless but earned the title of the local devil by beingblamed for all the evils in the world and sacrificed to achieve peace.InFinal Fantasy II, the final bossgoes to Hell and becomes Satan by killing him.Beezlebub, however, is a miniboss that can be foundin front of a certain treasure chest, and as a bonus boss in theBonus Level, in which you play as the characters that died during the main storyline.There is athemeamong theGhosts 'n Goblinsvillains, as they're all named after some variant of Satan. The actual Satan isThe Dragonto Astaroth, the most common recurring villain. Other villains include Beelzebub, Lucifer, Samael, and Hades.InGraffiti Kingdom, the devil is a horned, purple guy-looking-thing named Medium. When freed from his imprisonment, he takes over Canvas Kingdom and plans to rule the world.His son Tablet overthrows him and becomes the new devil, so \"devil\" is probably just a title for \"ruler of demons\" rather than an actual entity.Lucifer and Satan also appear inGranblue Fantasy(Both using theirRage of Bahamutdesigns) but as different entities. Despite this, they are connected:Lucifer is an import of theRage of Bahamutcharacter of the same name, but his with role vastly reimagined as of the story event \"What Makes the Sky Blue\" in order to distinguish the two games' worlds from each other. In this games universe, Lucifer is theBig Goodwho serves as thesupreme primarch, an entity that exists on a higher planedue to his power leveland protects the Sky Realm from threats they would otherwise be incapable of handling. He commands the other angels, though particularly the tetra-element primarchs (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel)note\"particularly\" because they're the most important of the \"High primarchs\"and acts as aCosmic Keystonefor the elements Light and Dark, keeping them in balance and regulating them. In terms of personality, he is quite serious, especially about his duties, oblivious to various things (jokes,hatred, andeven love) but is ultimately shown to be a benevolent, selfless and self-sacrificing entity. as well, unlike most depictions of Lucifer, he is quite a sympathetic character, whose duty made him incapable of forming genuine connections with those he commanded. In fact,a big part of his character is how desperately he wanted to have a friend. Lucifer doesn't fall in this universethough a character named Luciliusnote\"Lucifaa\", another spelling/pronunciation of \"Lucifer\" in Japanesewas created to fill that aspect of the mythological characters descent.Satan (renamed Black Beast) appears in this universe, however he is much less of a character and more of a screaming, mindless beast. This is due to his being a mass of fallen angel cores sealed into one being with the purpose of one day destroying the world as a part of his creators plan. He was sealed away by Lucifer, who himself acted as a living seal for the character which would remain intact for as long as his powers were.InHades, one of the unlockable Aspects for the Exagryph (an Ancient Greek assault rifle with an underbarrel grenade launcher) is Lucifer's laser rifle that he used in his war on God. While the Olympians don't actually know anything about Lucifer other than his name and that he fought his father, the fact that Zagreus is using his weapon in rebellion on his own father is something that is noted.Helltaker: Lucifer appears as one of thedemon girls of Hell, referred to as \"Lucy\" byBeelzebub. She's a beautiful white-haired and white-horned woman withred eyesand wearing asnazzy black and red suit. She's characterized as a calculating bureaucrat and business woman (even going by the title of \"CEO of Hell\") who enjoys tempting humans withAn Offer You Can't Refusethat more often than not results inYour Soul Is Mine!. Despite this, however, she's also aTsunderewho decides to join the Helltaker's harem upon being bribed withchocolate pancakes, and shows a surprisingly caring side when she even helps Helltaker make food for the rest of harem in the ending.Mortal Kombathas a backstory character named Lucifer who is in charge of the Netherrealm (an infinite, fiery, wasteland where evil goes to rot, blatantly Hell).And he's apparently overthrown by Shinnok, a fallen Elder God, a high ranking divine being who fell from grace.The ninja fromThe Ninja Kidsdeal with a bunch of satanists, terrorists and assorted evildoers who want to \"resurrect\" Satan. They succeed, and you have to fight him as the final boss.Oyadori No Kohas him as theBig Badwho directed his worshippers to kidnap nine people every year and send them toHellin hopes of freeing himself. You play as one of the victims.Though in this case,\"he\"is a cute teen-looking schoolgirl named Emokinia.She's still just as evil and dangerousas one would expect.Pokémon Diamond and PearlGiratina is the Pokemon universe's cosmic Satan right down to Lucifer's banishment from Heaven. Giratina along with the other members of the Creation Trio helped Arceus create and bring balance to the universe, with each of them representing a fundamental aspect of the cosmos; Dialga representing Time, Palkia representing Space, and Giratina representing Antimatter.

Tends to be theFinal Boss(or at least one of them), as well as acheater. However, this seems to bePlayed for Laughs; Satan liked Hawaiian T-shirts, wanted tomarryArle instead of killing her, and his plans were absolutely harmless (without theFridge Horror). Even in Sega's run, he never actually did anything evil, and he even became a technical big brother to another horned character.His presence actually dates back to the earlier RPG series,Madou Monogatari, where he's the final boss of the second game. He also has a bit part in SFC remake of the original, where he's noticeably charmed by the 5-year-old Arle.Oddly enough, in Sega's run, they did add aBig Red Devilthat was a spirit, sealed in a book for a long enough time for the text about it to fade. Though, this spirit wasalsoharmless, as the most it did when it was the villain was try and bring its former body back forsomething.Puzzle & Dragonshas Satan in three flavors. There is the descended version of Satan that disables healing but has one of the biggest damage nuke skills in the game. There is alsotwoversions of Lucifer, one as an Archangel and the other as an Archdemon from the REM machine.Both LuciferandSatan appear inRage of Bahamut, though Lucifer plays more of an active role as the incarnation of theFallen Angelthat terrorizes Mystaria. While initially believed to be aJerkassthat was evil for the sake of being evil, his backstory reveals that he isfairly sympathetic. As it goes, he was a former Arch Seraph that was loyal to his “God”, the goddess of justice and eternity Arbiter Mortis who would send him on missions to wipe out those who disrupt the peace of the world and the heavens. As it turns out, she would also send him to wipe out innocents that she felt disrupted the peace, even framing a young boy who was capable of summoning monsters as the murderer of an entire village so as to trick Lucifer into getting rid of him. After being unable to save the boy and finding out he’d been used, Luciferquestioned his faithand fell, thus rebelling against the God’s, having a curse placed upon him that fueled his evilness until the protagonists travel through time to reverse everything and change him. By the end of everything, he becomes anAnti-Herothat fights on the side of the protagonists, but still hates the God’s.Red Dead Redemptionfeatures a series of Stranger missions with an obviously wealthy and intelligent man who sends John on bizarre missions that only an omnipotent being could know of, always making the options quite clear to John, such as whether to rob or help a nun, or to stop or encourage a man to cheat on his wife. He also makes remarks that he is an \"accountant\" and that he hopes his son grows up to be \"like John.\" It gets even more bizarre, after John shoots him in the back of the head three times and he continues to walk away, unharmed. Later on, he can be seen both atthe execution of John Marston and then once more at his funeral. And the spot of his last encounter? The future location of John's grave. Though by his accord, it's \"Quite a nice place.\"Though there is a bit of a debate amongst players as to whether he is The Devil, The Grim Reaper, or God. All three view points have compelling evidence, and it was probably Rockstar's intention to make it ambiguous enough that it could be whichever one you think it is.Saints Row: Gat Out of Hellhas aBig Red Devilversion of Satan as the main villain, who plans to marry off the Boss to his daughter, Jezebel, in Hell.In the visual novel gameSeraphim Slum, the player inhabits the role of \"Ezekiel\", a dark-haired woman withglowing red eyes, who is truly an incarnate of Lucifer causing the angels in the slum to fall from grace.The Secret Worldfeatures Eblis Dominus Inferni In Profondis as the main villain of the game's Hell arc. Having helped create the Hell Dimensions while still a member ofthe Host, in the millennia since his fall from grace, he's used his superior technological knowledge to enslave the Hellspawn and use them as a means of eventually taking over Earth. Character-wise, he's anEvil Colonialistwho considers himself superior to both humans and demons alike, and spends most of his time onscreen abusing his demonic servants and belittling humans. However, despite being one of the toughest Dungeon bosses in the entire game, he's just aBig Bad Wannabethat wouldn't have been able to begin invading Earth if he hadn't capturedTheodore Wickerearly in the arc, and ends up being forced into a humiliating retreat when Wicker is able to beat him in aWizards Duel. Plus, he spends most of the game being hopelessly overshadowed by more powerful villains, most prominentlythe Dreamers.In theShin Megami Tenseiseries, Lucifer isalwaysaround the corner, pulling strings in his quest to defeat YHVH. He often appears as a blonde human, named (groan)Louis Cypher(or inone entry,Louisa Ferre.). But nobody ever seems to get it anyway, so to Hell with it...his posse inShin Megami Tenseiincludes Beelzebub, Asura, Arioch, the gender-confused Astaroth, and Norse baddie Surt.Satan, on the other hand, isGod's servant(of thehasatanflavor in the original Hebrew tradition), as showcased inShin Megami Tensei II; needless to say, Lucifer and Satan donotget along. The kicker: God manages to be sucha massive jerkinShin Megami Tensei IIthat Satan gets fed up and joins the player should he choose the Law path.In thePersonaseries, you cansummonSatan. And Lucifer. And Lucifer's prettier version (usually called Helel). Put two of the three (it changes depending on the version) into the main character's lineup in3and you can use Armageddon, which kills...anything and everything, really.

Aside from being as insanely powerful as you'd expect from aSuperbossin an SMT game, he only appears in Hard Mode.InSonic the Hedgehog (2006)we have Mephiles the Dark (named after Mephistopheles fromFaust) and Iblis (named after theIslamicversion of Satan). The former is aManipulative BastardandConsummate Liaracting like the False Prophet and the latter is a mindless destructive monster acting like the Beast of Revelation. They are revealed to be the two separated aspects ofSolaris, asungodwhohas the power AND desire to destroy all of existance (or at least the space-time continuum). What makes them so terrifying is that they actuallysucceededin their plan even after the heroes defeated them by aCosmic Retcon.When they first fuse back intoSolaris, the initial result is a creature with6 stones on his back, 6 claws, and 6 horn segments on his head.After 06 ended up creating aCosmic Retconof its own that struck it from Canon, the next closest thing to Satan in Sonic appears to beDark Gaia. A being born before time, and an \"incarnation of darkness, night and destruction\". It also has a suitably demonic design, corrupts anything its energies touch, lives within the Earth's core, has control over a list monsters that attack people on the surface during the events ofSonic Unleashed, and is in a constant war of death and rebirth with Light Gaia, the Divine counter to the Demonic. When Eggman awakens it inUnleashed, it tears the world into fragments and corrupts many within it -including Sonic himself.Bonechill fromSuper Paper Mariois anExpyof Satan, specifically the Satan fromThe Divine Comedy, being a giant six-winged ice dragon who was imprisoned in the bowels ofthe Underwherewith his army.

He's pretty glad to see the mercs and rewards them with their own spellbook if they survive.TF Comics #6also featuresa more traditionalBig Red Devilwho Medic sold his soul to. Medic then proceeds to revealhe stole his friends' souls and grafted them onto himselfin order to con Satan into giving him an extra half-century on Earth,and his pen.Tekkenhas the Devil Gene, which allows members of the Mishima family (besidesHeihachi) to turn into a Devil, and the Devil Forms of Kazuya and his son Jin are usually considered the strongest combatants in the game as far as story goes. Jinpachi, Heihachi's father and theBig BadofTekken 4, was initially thought to have the Devil Gene as well, butWord of Godstated Jinpachi was underDemonic Possessionfrom a different powerful evil spirit.Note: this was passed over to them through at least one (Kazuya)Faustian dealwith anevil wingedManipulative Bastardcalled...Devil.Tekken 7explains the Devil Gene actually comes from Heihachi’s wife and Kazuya’s mother Kazumi and her family the demonic Hachijo clan. Kazumi in herSuperpowered Evil Sidetries to kill her husband, revealing her plan to wipe out the Mishimas who she deemed as a threat.

But the latest game's story goes further than that. It has the Preacher convinced that Calypso isthe devil himself, and the details on the differences between him and the other versions of Calypso make this allegation hard to argue against.ULTRAKILL:Testament IV inlevel 5-Sreveals that Lucifer questioned the purpose of Hell, a place wheresinners are cruelly tormented for all eternity for the most minor of sins.God found Himself unable to answerbecause He was unable to face the fact that, after failing to create a version of humanitywithout free will, He created Hell in order to condemn them for failing to follow his law, only to find thatHe no longer had the powertounmakeHell. Upon being asked such a question by Lucifer, God panicked andcast him into Hell,something that He came to deeply regret once He calmed down.InThe Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Geralt encounters Gaunter O'Dimm, a seemingly ordinary merchant of mirrors who proves to be aterrifyingly powerfulmaster of strange magicsand who forms pacts with others to give them gifts, in exchange for eventually taking their souls throughmanipulating the hell out of the wordings of his contracts. A conversation with a scholar who researched O'Dimm reveals him to be an ancient, malicious being who goes by many titles, but the most consistent one was \"Evil Incarnate.\" Much like Old Scratch, he uses classic tropes associated with Satan, such as making deals and bargains for souls and often striking those bargains at crossroads. And ultimately,Geralt cannot kill him; the only way to beat O'Dimm is to beat him in a game of wits to win back the soul of the man he had condemned.\n\nWeb AnimationThe Fear Holehas a biological manifestation of the concept of Satan inthis episodewho functions as anIneffectual Sympathetic Villain.And then there's the real one...TheHellaverseportrays Lucifer and Satan as different individuals as per the traditional list of arch-demons associated with theSeven Deadly Sins, and both have a kind of rulership position in Hell.Lucifer Morningstar is aFallen Angel, the Sin of Pride and the realKing of Hell. He is married toLilith, with whom he has one daughter calledCharlie. He's not evil, only rebellious and now depressed because his attempt to give humans free will led to the creation of Hell and his being confined there with all the demons and depraved souls.Satan, on the other hand, is the Sin of Wrath, and he's eventually seen inHelluva Boss, where he lords over everyone including otherDemon Lords and Archdevilsin Lucifer's absence. The demons of Hell are heard regularly swearing in his name (\"Oh my Satan!\"), but this may also be because they are often imps, and he is the creator of imp-kind. He also claims that he was the ruler before Lucifer, butWord of Godrevealsthis to be a lie.Retarded Animal Babieshas Satan as a recurring character, often with his name screwed with to make other names for himself, such as \"Stan\" or \"Santa\".Bedrock Person's Gascot is the universe's Satan, while not the Biblical portrayal, more like a self-fabricated rather akratic sociopath.\n\nWebcomicsThe Angel with Black Wings— An angel mentioned the name \"Lucifer\" in Chapter 12: Enemy, Page 27.Blipfeatures variations on both the Jewish and the Christian versions of Satan, as separate characters. Lucifer is the angel who rebelled against God and currently rules Hell—he's also aBishōnenand a surprisingly nice guy (who still wants to destroy the world). \"The Adversary\" fills the role of God's prosecuting attorney and Loyal Opposition; he's much less nice. In spite of being on opposite sides of a war, the two of them get along rather well.Beyond the End: Hal is on the run from Lucifer, after having lived with him for a few centuries. He's said that Lucifer was clingy to the point of being stifling and Death has said Lucifer has anger issues that he's not keeping in check. This is pretty confirmed with how much shouting and threatening to kill peopleand actually killing Mortishe does.Bob and George: He's Bob's grandpa. But he's only mentioned once. Does it mean thatGeorgeis actually ademon?Satan appears inCasey and Andynot only as a woman, but as the girlfriend of one of the title characters.InCollege Roomies from Hell!!!, demons first appeared as throwaway characters who were summoned by theineptSatanists Waldo and Steve, but refused to do their bidding. Later, as the stripbecame more serious, they actually manage to summon Satan (as opposed to the previous nameless minor demons), and, after trying to take Dave's soul, he began showing a clear personal interest in the main characters, quickly proving to have been theBig Badof the seriesall along.Parody: InDinosaur Comics, Satan is seemingly a videogame-obsessed nerd. He's never seen directly, instead being represented by red text coming from below the panel border.Also, T-Rex is the only person who can hear Satan (orGod, for that matter), leading the other characters to occasionally speculate that T-Rex is making up those voices he hears.Satan is a main character inHoly Bibblewhere he is a bit of a trickster, though several comics have implied that he has more up his sleeve than we're initially led to believe.Homestuckhas a character named, well,Doc Scratch, who told the heroes that they could escape their current situation and the unstoppable villain hunting them if inexchangethey would allow his master to enter the fray. He succeeds as he is omniscient, multi-dimensional, and an excellent host.And then there's Scratch's boss himself,Lord English.He's from an alien race known asCherubs. He also kills God...or at leasttheauthor.Given the primary focus ofJack, it's not surprising that Satan makes occasional appearances, in a form similar to David Hopkins'furrypersona (a blue skunk), only with all-black eyes.Hera fromOb Mil Yandere Gamesis a female version of Satan. Whatever creature she is, she preys on humans or challenges them to a deadly game which metaphorically feels like aDeal with the Devilsituation. Her boyfriend Riko (who is the protagonist) has a striking resemblance to theGrim Reaper. Which means Satan and Death are a couple in this series.MAG-ISA: Though Satan isn't shown directly in this comic, thebad guys are admittedly in the service of Satan. They masquerade as \"good\", though, since Satan masquerades as an angel of light. (2 Corinthians 11:14)Lucifer's niece Cassiel (who, while not a fallen angel, is still distinctly petty and vindictive) is the residentIneffectual Sympathetic VillaininMisfile. Lucifer himself is confirmed to exist within the comic's universe, but hasn't put in a personal appearance...yet.Narbonic: A while after Mell returns from Hell, she is having trouble getting interested in things, and asks her boyfriend the ex-demon if Satan ever got listless and unmotivated.

Good to know.He's a main character inSatan and Me.The Devil appears as a main character inSinfest. He operates a deal booth styled like Lucy's booth inPeanuts, and is antagonized by The Faceless God, who mocks him with a silly handpuppet. Aside from various taunts against God and attempts to tempt people or buy their souls, he is generally presented as a neutral or even sympathetic character compared to the petty and whimsical God.Satan has made a handful of appearances inSluggy Freelance, most notably being summoned onto Riff's computer in the strip's firstStory Arc, and for being the father ofThe Evil.InManga Punk Sai'sThe Story From Hellhas Satan and Lucifer as two separate characters: loyal angel Satan is in charge of Hell, and his rather thankless duties include hunting down fallen angel Lucifer whenever he manages to run off to Earth. (On closer inspection, Sai seems to have taken down the main storyline, but there's still plenty of character art and Omake arcs there.)It can still be foundstarting here, though it's pretty old now and nothing like what she plans it to be in the future.Satan is a minor character in theMagic: The GatheringwebcomicUG Madness, usually working with Magic R&D director Mark Rosewater (portrayed as a comical imp). His first appearance was inthis strip.Being a webcomic about a student getting demonic powers,Underlingfeatures a rather dickish Satan.The folkloric devil is often discussed inWest of Bathurst, a slice of life comic, as seenhere. The longer the comic goes on, the more likely it seems that one character actually is the devil.InZoophobia, he isDamian'sfatherandJack'suncle.Kill Six Billion Demonshas no actual satan-figure, but two very close ones.The Red Eyed King was a devil from the age of gods thattried to end existence itself out of a lust for destruction, a being so powerful and wicked that he matched theGod of EvilAesma in wickedness (she, obviously,fell in love with him at first sight). At the current stage of the universe he exists only in stories; Aesma, love-spurned, beat him into submissionwith the universe while they were both still inside it.Jagganoth is known as the Red-Eyed Heir, and is set on the same path of omnicide that the Red Eyed King followed.The entity known only as \"Myself\" is a strange devil, as they are simultaneously the King of all Devilsandthe most important prisoner kept by the Council of Thirteen, the ruling council of the Devils. As anOxymoronic Being, Myself's existence breaks all the known laws of the universe and he is, as such, extraordinarily dangerous. Their face isn't seen throughout the comic, but they are partly-omniscient and their voice has the power to warp reality, things that, in theory, should only be possible with divine power.Lotus Cobra Is Evil: The first comic,\"Lotus Cobra Is Evil\"◊, about \"master of evil\" Lucifer, wanting to be represented by said Lotus Cobra.\n\nWeb OriginalsBennett the Sage. Are you really surprised?noteWell Sage was.He's at least able to make a good impression...Satan appears occasionally onAsk That Guy with the Glasses. Ask That Guy works for him, however Satancan be unnerved by what he says.Also, the Nostalgia Critic made a comment that Satan goes to the Devil Devil when he's not being evil enough.Satan has also made a debut in theSon of the Maskreview, where it's revealed that he's married to Kim Kardashian and has a daughter with her, named Evillina (who is aMy Little Ponyfangirl who apparently chats with CR and is far less evil than her father would like). He makes another appearance in theCat in the Hatreview, where he's shownpitching the moviePlanesto Pixar, andis aPapa Wolfwhen the movie's creator tries to subject the Critic and Evillina to a movie-marathon of the recently-made Dr. Seuss adaptations. As it turns out, the creator only had financial success because he sold his soul to the Devil.\"The most frightening religious painting in the world,\" according toBishop Barron'svlog on The Devil, is a fresco which depictsThe Antichristspeaking before a crowd with the Devil whispering to him. TheinvokedNightmare Fuelin the fresco is the Devil's hands, which he has put through the Anti-Christ's robes and out of his sleeves so the Devil's hand just appear to be those of another human.\"It's very clever way of influence us. Indirectly, clandestinely, by insinutation. In such a way that, heck, it looks like our activities, yet it's the dark powers having invaded.\"Satan and Hmac fromEpic Storytimewere good friends in college. Lucifer had apparently been areal party animaland alsoloved to smoke tons of Marijuana. They became best friends near graduation and when they made it out of college, the two stayed drinking buddies and had went to the bar every Friday night since then. Hmac later returned to the underworld, seeking him for answers of who was attacking the U.S. and why.Heavilyimpliedin theMandela Catalogue. The \"Alternate\" who disguises itself as theArchangel Gabrielis stated in all but name to actually be theDevil in Disguise, andto have hijacked the world's major religions to secretly be the worship of himself.In RostoAD'sMind My Gap, we haveVirgil S. Horn. As the series narrator and villain, Rosto and he don't exactly say he's the devil, but when Virgil covers the second \"a\" in his middle name...besides being a villain, he owns a TV show and is a (con)cept artist.InMr. Deity, Lucifer is \"Lucy\", an ex-girlfriend of the titular Mr. Deity, who got stuck with the Hell gig after she did Mr. Deity a favour in stirring up things in the Garden of Eden. She's particularly annoyed by the constant \"passive-aggressive\" references to her being a \"snake\" in the \"script\", and would much prefer her avatar on Earth to be a bunny. She's not impressed by Mr. Deity's alternative suggestion of a goat.The short film\"Raking Leaves\"by comedy troupeStellaand Bradley Cooper involves a rather unexpected appearance.Appears quite a bit in the first,Hell-centricbook ofThe Salvation War. He's a colossalJerkass, and a bit of an idiot. Hardly surprising that the human war effort wants to kill him with extreme prejudice.Dr. ClefofTheSCP Foundationmay or may not be Lucifer. A storyline involving bothDr. ClefandSCP-239strongly implies it. His response when interviewed about it is to first claim he is, then claim he was lying, then point out there's no way to be sure whether he was lying about being Lucifer, or lying about lying about it. Oh, and if this is the case,SCP-239may or may not also be the physical incarnation of God or the Second Coming of Christ.Word of Godsays that he'snotSatan in the traditional sense, but hedoesrebel against God (Not to mention the Foundation's lore already has a more blatantSatanic Archetypein the form ofThe ScarletKing. Word of God also says thatClef'sthe one who cast Adam and Eve out of Eden, which either makes him the serpent or the Archangel Jophielwhich, incidentally, would make Clef hisownSCP-001 proposal.Satan Ira, also known as Wrath, fromThe Seven Sinistersis a female SatanAlthough he has yet to physically appear inShadowhunter Peril, there have been several references to his existence in the Infernal Worlds. The firstBig Bad's last name is \"Morgenstern\" (which means \"Morning Star\", one of Lucifer's many names), and hisOne-Winged Angelform appears to be a subtleShout-Outto the version of Lucifer depicted as having six wings. By far the biggest references would be Puriel flying into anUnstoppable Rageat the mention of Lucifer—he also states once or twice that he has fought in the war in Heaven, which could mean he and Lucifer actually did meet. So far, though, the closest thing SP has to a Satan-like figure is Asmodeous, who is the first son of Lilith, and the only demon to have a fallen angel (Samael) for a father—in fact,the only demon to have a father at all.He's currently king of the Infernal Worlds, so where that leaves Lucifer in the hierarchy is unknown.Seen here burying dinosaur bones to confuse the minds of men in this ironic Teach the Controversyt-shirt.TheWhateley Universehas something that claims to be Satan.

However, she eventually left the throne as she no longer cares about Hell or even maintaining her power as Lucifer, and instead wants to help people go to Heaven. She has softened over the years due to being with Ruvyzvat.Sarvente shows off both her nun and demon forms in theFriday Night Funkin'Game Modshe got featured in,Mid-Fight Masses.The Star War Gatheringshas him mentioned a few times.\n\nWestern AnimationAngel Wars: He doesn't make an appearance in the series proper, nor are any plots explicitly stated to be started by him in play. But the ramifications of the war he started in Heaven and the way other demons act show he's got a powerful effect on the plot and the setting. He's called \"The Dragon\" by the angels and demons in-universe, but hedoesn'tfitthat tropeat all as far as this wiki is concerned.In theAnimaniacsepisodeHot, Bothered & Bedeviled, the Warners mess with the Devil himself.InAqua Teen Hunger Force, Satan is never seen onscreen, but usually sets MC Pee Pants on fire forfailing him, to the point that MC Pee Pants's last exploit was to try to become a vampire to avoid going to Hell.InThe Boondocks, Satan trains Stinkmeaner in martial arts, sends his spirit back to Earth as a reward, and gets called a\"BITCH ASS NYUGGA!\"for all his trouble.He's nothing less than impressedbyStinkmeaner's hatredandsheer audacity.The short-livedCartoon NetworkseriesClass of 3000had an episode where Lil' D signs a contract to become famous with a large man with a goatee and a red suit referred as \"Big D\". As if it wasn't obvious enough, \"Big D\" hassupernatural powers, a pair of creepy snake-like men accompanying him, and a company located miles below the surface.The Devil is the explicit identity of the villain in the pilot episode ofCow and Chicken. This getsBowdlerisedfor the series proper, and he's only called \"The Red Guy\" from there on out, even though it's glaringly obvious he's the Devil; they might have a point, though, because as the series goes on, he was turned from outright evil to anIneffectual Sympathetic Villain.\"The Red Guy\" is also a regular character onI Am Weasel. In the series, he is also referred as \"I.B. Red Guy\", an allusion to I.M. Weasel's and I.R. Baboon's names.OnThe Critic, Satan is responsible for many of Hollywood's problems (such as unnecessary sequels and Marisa Tomei winning an Oscar). The cast ofWingsonce asked him for another season on the air (\"There are limits to even MY powers!\"). He also appears in the episode \"Siskel & Ebert & Jay & Alice\" with Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert when Gene is interviewing possible replacements:Satan:[transformed as a reviewer]Tim Allen gives that same likeable performance we always love, once again proving Disney Pictures have the magic touch that may not win awards, but keeps America smiling.

While there are overlords in Hell and criminals fight in turf wars over parts of Pentagram City, everyone recognizes Lucifer as the man on top.Though most denizens of Hell don't respect authority, they fear Lucifer's power enough to show fealty.In person, he strikes a good deal less of an intimidating figure than the myths would have you believe, as he is averydivorced man who spends his days making rubber ducks as a hobby and has a panic attack when his daughter calls unexpectedly.The top-tierDemon Lords and Archdevilsin the show are rulers of rings of Hell based on theSeven Deadly Sins, and Lucifer's sin is Pride. Satan is a separate character from Lucifer, and is the ruler of Wrath, as per an old typology of demon lords corresponding to the seven sins that also mentions Lucifer and Satan separately.A version of him is theBig BadonJimmy Two-Shoes. That isLucius Heinous VII, ruler of Miseryville, which is implied to beFire and Brimstone Hell(although he and Miseryville are explicitly Satan and Hell in the pilot). While Lucy (as Jimmy calls him)isn't very dangerous, his family line gets nastier as it goes back to Lucius I, who looks something like a traditional depiction of Satan in a suit andis feared by even his descendants.Looney Tunes:In the cartoon \"Satan's Waitin\", he is depicted as a Hector-esque bulldog, as Sylvester,a cat, is the one sent to Hell.\"Waitin' For Satan\" has Yosemite Sam in hell facing the Devil who will grant Sam a reprieve if he can deliver Bugs Bunny to him.

He's not as evil as you might think, but he hates his daughter's boyfriend...a DJ called Jesús.Believe it or not, he actually appeared in theMartin Morningepisode \"A Good Little Devil\", although since it's a kids' show he was referred to as Lucifer rather than Satan. In the episode, he was depicted as aCorrupt Corporate Executivewho almost tricked the show's titular character into signinga pact with himso that he couldbecome a normal boyand not be subject to his dailyJust Woke Up That Waycondition anymore, by having a demoness impersonate hisLove InterestRoxanne and having her try to convince him that it's the right thing to do and would make her happy. Thankfully,the real Roxanne arrived just in timeto expose the demoness and prevent Martin from signing the pact, and Martin used his trident (he was a demon himselfon that day) to turn Lucifer and the demonessto stone.Popeye: In \"Seein' Red, White and Blue,\" Popeye and Bluto (who is trying to avoid getting drafted into the Navy) fall down an elevator shaft so deep they wind up in Hell.

Which was the number #1 thing you must not do when playing the game. Satan'scheerful admonishmentas they arrive in Hell: \"So, you whizzed on the electric fence, didn't ya?\"According to some of the sketches done for \"Sven Hoek\", Satan was apparently supposed to be George Liquor in a devil costume. In the final cartoon, he still looks more than a little like George and is even voiced byMichael Pataki.In theRick and Mortyepisode \"Something Ricked This Way Comes\",Lucius Needfuloperates a store that gives mystical items with some curse attached to them. Rick immediately calls him out as the Devil, causing Needful to drop any attempts at being mysterious, andproceeds to humiliate him throughout the entire episode.Rocko's Modern LifehadPeaches the Dark Lord, who regularly showed up to try claim Heffer's soul, although a few of the episodes he appeared in havegone missing.A proposed episode ofSealab 2021called \"Ronnie\" would have Satan show up to try to make aDeal with the Devilwith Murphy. He's shown as a blond man, sometimes with the goat hooves. Stalin and Hitler pop by and address Satan as Ronnie, hence the episode title.

If Tom fails, he'll be sent to Hell where the devil—an underworld vision of Spike the bulldog—eagerly awaits him.Unicron is pretty much theTransformersequivalent of Satan, and even kind of looks like a robotic version of the stereotypicalBig Red Devil. He's aplanet-eatingEldritch Abominationthat's literallypowered by concepts like hatred and strife. He seeks to corrupt or destroy all existence becausehe finds it personally offensive. Sometimes he makesdealswith mortals, promising power or some other such thing in exchange for their service, but these deals never end well for the mortal. He's also notably more successful then the typical Satan-figure; he's destroyed at least 20% of the local multiverse andhe apparently once succeeded in destroying all reality. The only reason anything exists now is because he missed a few fragments and went dormant, allowing reality to reform. He wasn't happy when he woke up.",

The male Satan is more prominent, and he tries to dissuade Jesus by showing future events like the Crusades.Satan appears as an androgynous person (portrayed by a female actress) inThe Passion of the Christ. Notable for three scenes: the initial temptation of Jesus in the beginning of the film, a truly disturbing scene during Jesus's torture where Satan is seen cradling a demonic baby, in a mockery of the Virgin Mary, and a shot of Satan screaming in Hell, enraged at Jesus' sacrifice for humanity's sins and spiritual triumph.InLast Days In The Desert, set during Jesus's desert sojourn,Ewan McGregorplays bothJesus and Satan. The latter is dressed nigh-identically but wears jewellery.InThe Young Messiahhe's a blond, bearded man wearing a Black Cloak who torments Jesus at various points in the story, such as the beginning of the film when the bully is killed, and when Jesus is ill.",

In a rather fine example of outbargaining the devil for a favor,Constantine cuts his wrists and calls the Devil. After some idle chitchat, with the Devil helping John light up a cigarette, Constantine points the Devil to the fact his son and an angel are planning on releasing Satan's son onto earth. This irks the Devil as he feels Earth will be his in time and sends his son back to hell and, with God's blessing, turns the angel to human. The Devil returns to Constantine and offers him some more time as thanks. Instead of that, Constantine asks him to release the soul of the heroine's sister, who was damned for her suicide. The Devil does so easily. As the Devil is about to take him away, Constantine starts getting pulled up into heaven (and flips him off), and the Devil realizes that his \"suicide\" was really a self-sacrifice as he took no personal gain from the reward given. However, thinking quickly, he decides to use his powers to heal both Constantine's wrists and his cancer, using the logic that he's giving Constantine more time to damn himself again.

After two years of silence, being shuttled from one mental health facility to another, he reveals to his latest psychiatrist that he is actually Satan. She initially brushes this off as a common claim she hears in her line of work; besides, she doesn't believe in God or Satan. But during one of his first meetings with her he takes off her ring andmelts it in his hand, and not long afterward exerts psychic control over one of her other patients — the most innocent person in the asylum — and turns them into a serial killer as well, specifically targeting men of the cloth to boot. Mister Frost explains to her that humanity chalking evil up to mental illness/deviance rather than believing in himhas cost him the power he once held over them, and his master plan to reassert himself is to not only convince her that he is Satan, but to drive her to cross aGodzilla Thresholdandkill his human form, which would ruin her lifeand stop him from sowing further chaos. He explains his relationship to God (and theirs to humanity) as a simpleCosmic Chess Game: \"It used to be simple, good on one hand and evil on the other. There was a struggle. We had a game, and yes, we made it up.\"",

Of course, the Doctor's skeptical, since he's met so many \"real\" versions of mythological beings, though as he acknowledges, the stories have to startsomewhereand this particular entity is a much better candidate for that than most.

Because of his evil, God curses the Serpent by pitting humanity against him, telling of how the offspring of the woman will crush the Serpent's head.TheBook of Jobintroduces its exploration of the problem of evil, the idea that an infinitely good God could not exist if there is evil, by painting a scene where the satan, or \"the accuser\" in English, goes to God's court and wagers that God's most righteous follower, Job, can be turned away from Him if he was faced with evil and suffering. With God's allowance, Satan strips Job of his property, his wealth, his family, and his health, and goes unmentioned as Job questions why God would allow such a thing.AsJesusfasted in the desert for forty days,The Four Gospelsattest that the Devil tempted him byquoting Scriptureto try and get him to break his fast, test God by jumping from the top of a temple, and bow to Satan in exchange for rule over the kingdoms of the world. Christ has a Scriptural response to deny Satan at every turn and leaves the desert completely unfazed by everything the Prince of Lies threw at him.TheBook of Revelationgives us the image of a great red dragon with seven heads, one who leads one-third of the angels in Heaven against God and hisArchangel Michael, only to be thrown out of the Heavens, as the narration reveals that the Dragon would come to be known as the Serpent of Genesis, the Devil, and Satan.

Satan brainwashed and possessed one of the titular Lords of Shadow, and under that guise, accompanied the protagonist, Gabriel Belmont, waiting while the latter assembled an artifact that would allow him to re-enter Heaven and take revenge upon God. Gabriel thwarted Satan's plan, and with God's help, banished him back to Hell.Satan returns inCastlevania: Lords of Shadow 2, this time around, however, with a different motive: he wishes to enslave both Gabriel and Zobek following his humiliating defeat. This prompts the two mortal enemies to join forces and use their combined powers to locate and eliminate Satan's Acolytes on Earth.Ultimately — intentionally — Gabriel fails, and the last surviving Acolyte summons his father. But despite all of his prowess and cunning, Satan is defeated once more, and Gabriel pierces his heart with the Vampire Killer, putting an end to the original Prince of Darkness.",
